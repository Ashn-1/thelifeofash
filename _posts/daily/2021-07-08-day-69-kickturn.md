I went skateboarding today with a friend and we practiced some tricks. I mainly focused on learning how to kickturn while standing still.

I got pretty confident on doing toeside kickturns, but still struggle a little with heelside kickturns. Somehow, turning in the direction I can't see just seems so unnatural. Maybe it's easier if I turn my head and look in the direction I want to turn. Anyway, a little more practicing will definitely make this easier.

Next I want to practice kickturns while moving. Maybe I'll get some little cones and try to skate around them. That'll probably also be a nice challenge to tackle.

Other then kickturns, I want to practice throwing down my board, so I can get on my board faster and cooler, and also manuals. I will also search for some more beginner tricks on YouTube and see what I can find. I feel like learning some tricks now in the beginning will help me stay more motivated in the long run, when I get to the more advanced tricks that will need some time to learn.

Anyway, I really enjoy practicing skating üòÅ

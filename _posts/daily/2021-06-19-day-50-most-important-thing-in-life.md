I was just watching a YouTube video of a guy who travelled to Tanzania to [join the Hadza tribe for some hunts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Szbfq9IA4). This tribe is apparently one of the few hunter-gatherer tribes left in the world. The video was super interesting and I really enjoyed watching it. 

In another video he [interviewed the leader of the tribe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAGjuRwx_Y8). One of the questions he asked was what the most important thing in life was; the leader's answer was: meat, honey and corn porridge. When asked the question what his happiest day was, he answered that they are happy when they have meat and honey. When asked what he feared most in life, he answered: lions, elephants and leopards. 

It seems so simple, survival is the key aspect of their life, but because survival is not a concern in our modern world, our values and fears evolved to abstract concepts. Rather than concerning our life with the importance of living, we waste away day by day. I felt so stupid when I saw that video and the answers of the tribe leader. Here I am, having problems that only exist in my head and are consuming a large portion of my life, instead of appreciating that I don't have to concern myself with my own survival. 

It's somehow fascinating to me how far removed from reality modern life seems to be. To me, it seems like we lost the focus on what is truly important. But the truth is, I don't know what this truly important thing is; I lost my focus as well, drifting through an anxiety filled life like so many others. 

It seems fitting that this daily journal somehow circles around my cluelessness of what is important in my own life. I have no idea what the purpose of my life is or if there even is one. I don't know if there is a destination I can work towards or if I'll ever reach it. I feel lost in my own life like I'm drifting in an ocean with no land anywhere to be seen. But somehow, this interview made me more optimistic for my future. 

Meat and honey... I should probably start looking for the 'meat and honey' of my own life.

Even though I was born in the perfect time to live through the great pop punk era of the 2000s, I didn't actually start listening to this genre until around 2019. Back then, when I was on my semester abroad in Japan, I started listening to Sum 41, namely their 2004 album *Chuck*. 

I was instantly hooked from the energetic vibe and the catchy lyrics and melodies. And thus begin my journey through listening to some of the greatest pop punk bands of all time. From *Sum 41* and *Green Day* to *The Offspring* and recently also *Zebrahead*. After a while, I also quite enjoyed *Machine Gun Kelly*'s *Ticket to my Downfall*, a recent take on the pop punk genre mixed with rap elements.

I feel like this genre reflects what many people around my age feel and think like. For many this music feels nostalgic, reminding them of their childhood or their first concert. For me, it feels like found a new best friend that I only vaguely knew back then in school. 

I love this music ðŸŽ¶

Music tip: *Let The Bad Times Roll* from *The Offspring*

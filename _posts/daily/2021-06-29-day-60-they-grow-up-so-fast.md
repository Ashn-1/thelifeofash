Only half a year ago I held little Gunther in my arms for the first time and now he already has his first baby 😥

Now I do understand why parents want to take so many pictures of their children. I really should have made more pictures to see the growth of my little plants. Well, never to late to start right? And even though they are already big, they will certainly grow even further 😁

## Recap of Week 1

- **Blog:** worked on my blog/daily journal making the site prettier and writing posts
- **Sport:** started to cycle again, now that the weather is good again

## Plan for Week 2

- **University:** focus on watching lectures and working on university assignments

I came home Tuesday from a trip visiting a friend and had to work two days, so I didn't manage to get anything done for university. Otherwise I was pretty happy with how my week turned out.

For next week, I'll try to work on my university stuff and catch up with the lectures and work on my assignments both for one of the modules I have and also for my research practice.

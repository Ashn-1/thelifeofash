Continuing on the topic of yesterday, I feel like I need to go outside more often preferably when the sun is still out. I feel like sitting at home the entire day or just going to the supermarket just don't cut it anymore. I don't know what happened, but I just stopped going out for walks or cycling and only went out when I actually had something planned.

So, I will try to go outside everyday for the next couple days and weeks. I even put it into the habit tracker app that I use for other habits. I feel like this is gonna be a good start to get out of my physical and mental rut.

In short: fresh air and sun makes brain go brr ðŸ§

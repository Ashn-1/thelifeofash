Today, I went to a skatepark with a friend that was an hour away from where I live. There are some skateparks that are closer to me that are also somewhat decent, but this one looked particularly nice. 

Anyway, we arrived there just before 8pm, which is pretty late for a good ol' session of skateboard given you need to be able to see in order not to skate against obstacles. Still, we gave our all and practiced for one and a half hours. 

I tried to do an casper flip on ([see YouTube](https://youtu.be/Cnc3c6gSjsQ?t=84)), but was failing. The trick looked very straightforward, but I couldn't wrap my head around how this was supposed to work when standing there with my skateboard. I tried it a few times and apparently looked completely helpless, because another skater came by and showed me how to do it. He also gave me some more general tips on how to do tricks and things to keep in mind for all kind of tricks. Miraculously, I made it after trying a dry jump from the ground with the correct foot movement. That guy just made my day 😁

I didn't manage to do it again afterwards, but I'll get to it next time and make it consistent. As my great skateboard teacher said: 'Once is never; twice is once, so it is never; and the third time is always.' 

Thank you random skater boy 😊

Also, on the way back home I passed this... uhm... interesting construction:

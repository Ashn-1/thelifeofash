Last year during autumn I started to do some knitting. I finished my first scarf just before it got cold enough to actually wear it. It's a thick black scarf that would be super itchy, if I didn't have a thick and itchy beard to counter it.

Anyway, immediately after that I bought some colored wool and wanted to try another stitching method and do another scarf. I already showed the scarf half-done in a [previous post]({% post_url daily/2021-06-04-day-35-handicraft %}). Somehow that scarf took a little longer to finish. Not because it was fancier or more difficult to stitch, nope, rather I was too lazy ðŸ˜¬ But, lo and behold, after 9 months I finally finished the project:

It took way too long to finish this project, however, this only shows me once more that tiny steps each day add up into something big in no time. I didn't touch the scarf for a few months, but then I had this urge to finish it. So, I did a little knitting every day while watching some YouTube video or Twitch stream and after only two weeks or so I managed to finish the other half of the scarf.

To be honest, I probably won't wear this scarf myself, because it is way to colorful for my taste, but I like how it turned out nonetheless. Maybe I'll gift it to someone who actually wants to wear it, we'll see.

Still, it's nice to actually finish something for once ðŸ˜Š

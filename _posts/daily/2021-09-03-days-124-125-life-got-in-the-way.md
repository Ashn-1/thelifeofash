...but in a good way. I was doing something everyday and I kinda forgot to write an entry the last two days. Whoops.

And today is the same, I'll be going to a barbecue soon and don't have much time to write an extensive entry now. So here is the short version of my last two days:

- had my first workday as a permanent employee with my new contract
- went skating everyday for the last three days and made good progress
- my legs feel crushed and I love it
- I ate some good food
- the weather is nice

Well, that's about it. Also, I noticed that when you have something to do, you don't have time to be in your head and worry so much about life. That's great! üòÅ

Update: The vaccine did not, in fact, kill me. Besides some mild pain in my arm, I still don't have any side effects. I wonder if the second shot will be knocking me out, like I heard it does with other people. Let's hope not, but that is more than a month away anyway.

Otherwise nothing much happened today: I continued to work on my term paper, went skating and read a little. THe one interesting thing today was the weather. It was sunny the entire day and then suddenly it rumbled and thunders started. Then out of nowhere it started to pour down and hail at the same time, while still being sunny. Needless to say, I was very confused. Anyway, that rollercoaster of a weather made for a nice view from my window. Unfortunately, the picture doesn't look that good through the window and zoomed in. Anyway, here it is:

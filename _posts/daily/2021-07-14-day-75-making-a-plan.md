I read somewhere that you are more likely to succeed at something, if you make a plan. This is especially important if you got some sort of deadline coming up - like an exam. So I looked up all the lectures and tutorial videos I still got to watch and I wrote all of them down. Then I've set the number of videos I'll finish each day and set the according deadlines for lectures and tutorials. 

The lecture videso consists of 7 parts with a total of 12 chapters. I will finish at least one part every day that I am not working and do half a part every workday. This way I'll be finished by next week Saturday (July 24), which is also my deadline for watching the lectures. There are a total of 8 tutorials, which I will finish by July 27 corresponding to 3 tutorial per day and 2 on the last day (or 3 if another tutorial gets released by then). This will still give me another full week to learn the material. It's also not bad to have a little bit of a cushion in case my plan goes horribly wrong.

I'm currently not sure if my plan is doable or if it's way too ambitious and doomed to fail. If I realize it's too ambitious, I'll just restructure it - that's how plans are supposed to work anyway.

If I don't forget it, I'll do an intermediate review of my plan on July 24.

Anyway, I can't wait to finish these last few exams and then never set foot in an university again...

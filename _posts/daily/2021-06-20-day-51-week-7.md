## Recap of Week 7

- ❌ **University** finish first draft of my term paper
- ❌ **University** start watching lectures again
- ❌ **Blog** finish next blog post

## Plan for Week 8

- **University** finish first draft of my term paper
- **University** start watching lectures for first exam
- **Blog** finish next blog post

I actually didn't manage to get any of my focus points done this week, but that's okay. I wrote the majority of my term paper and finished the outline of my blog post. My focus points for next week are gonna be the same as this week, however, that has less to do with what I want to do and more to do with the upcoming deadlines. I have to submit my first final draft on Thursday and my first exam is in 2 weeks on July 9th.

As for my blog post, I really couldn't be bothered to write for my blog after writing for my term paper the entire day. I think this will change when I'm done with writing my term paper and have to learn for exams. I'll try to incorporate a fixed release day for my blog posts after my next blog post. I really want to focus on writing more in-depth and more thought out posts with more research behind them.

I'll also try to add more pictures to this daily blog. I rarely take pictures of things that I like or that look cool, just because I forget that this technology even exists. I hope that a picture a day will remind me of taking more pictures of beautiful and fascinating things.

Here is the first from my skating tour today:

I finished the mixing and the mastering for my first bass cover today. Then, I exported the track and went on YouTube to upload it, only to realize that I need to write a description for the video and create a thumbnail. Also, the video is just a black screen with the cover itself playing. Kinda lame...

Now I can decide between two possible decisions: upload the cover as is or record a video with me playing the song and make it a proper bass cover. While I'd prefer it to have a video, I think that recording a video and syncing everything up will take time, which in turn will delay the release of the cover. I think I might lose interest in doing this, if it takes so long to finish my first cover project up. 

As a result, I feel like the correct decision for right now is to just upload the video as is and move on to doing another cover. This will keep the focus on playing music and I will be able to develop my playing and my recording skills. I'll always be able to revisit this project later on, add a video to the cover and re-upload it to YouTube, if I desire to do so.

Hmm, I'll sleep over it and decide on this tomorrow.

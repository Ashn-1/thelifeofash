I've been playing bass now on and off for a few years and for as long as I have this bass, I've been meaning to record some bass covers of awesome songs. Unfortunately, I've been busy procrastinating this endeavor until now. Well, not anymore!

Recently, I've been practicing bass a lot more and I finally sat my ass down and recorded a cover of a very popular rock song. I finished recording the bass track today and now I have to add effects to the dry bass signal in order to make it sound better. As a little sneak peak, here is the bass DI that I recorded without the song and without any effects:

Maybe you recognize the song from the bass alone, otherwise you'll have to wait until the cover is finished ðŸ˜œ

... there is nothing to talk about today 🤷🏽‍♀️

I like that this journal forces me to write something everyday, so even if I'm not motivated I have to write something. I think if writing everyday would be optional, I just wouldn't write something most days, even if there were a great story to tell.

I should probably figure something out for the days where nothing noteworthy happens. Maybe I'll try to post a picture on these days as an alternative 🤔

So, I went to the drug store today to buy some soap and those things you strap on the inside of your toilette so it doesn't smell like shit (hÃ¶hÃ¶, you get it, smell like shit... hÃ¶hÃ¶ ðŸ’©).

Anyway, I went there and was searching around for the things I needed, when I noticed a girl going to one of the store clerks to ask her something. She looked like she was in her teens; had chestnut brown, shoulder-length hair and she was dressed alternative/rock-ish. She also seemed very shy from the way she approached the clerk and the way she talked. 

She asked the clerk if they had bleacher there, because she wanted to bleach her hair blonde. I was just standing there, staring at her hair and thinking 'You wanna do what to your gorgeous brown hair?'. I was kinda sad seeing her not being happy with the way she was. Dunno, I just got a soft spot for people, who are not content with their physical appearance. That tends to make me sad, when I see it...

I know that I made a lot of assumptions about that girl: she's probably insecure and thinks that changing her hair color will change that. That thought is indeed a long shot and if it is not the case and she just wants to do it for herself, all the power to her. But if not, know that you are perfect the way you are, brown-haired rock girl from the drug store ðŸ˜Š

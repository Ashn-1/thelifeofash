I got a new little member in my plant family! Welcome *Leonidas, the Spearmint*:

![leonidas](/assets/res/daily/day-159-leonidas.jpg)

Me and my brother wanted to plant some good old peppermint in our living room for fresh mint tea, but somehow I bought the wrong kind of mint. Then I just decided to grow a little spearmint plant in my own room, instead of letting the entire plant go to waste. Now that's what I call a happy little accident ðŸ˜Š

Now that I have Leonidas, I realize that I didn't give all my plants a name ðŸ¤” I'll get to it, the next few days.

Also, I really need to repot some of my plants here. They got way too big for the little starter pots I got them in, but I'm kinda putting it off now for weeks...

... procrastination, yeahhh ðŸ¥´

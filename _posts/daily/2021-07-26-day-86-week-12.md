## Recap of Week 12

- ‚úÖ **University** finish watching lectures for next exam
- ‚ùå **Blog** start writing the next blog post

## Focus for Week 13

- **University** learn your ass off for the next exam, so you can finally be done with statistics for the rest of your life

I actually managed to finish my lectures this week. I'm kinda impressed with myself üòÅ

And I actually did not start writing my next blog post. I guess with my upcoming exam I should have expected this outcome. I will also not start writing this post until after my exam in two weeks. Afterwards, I will try to finish it by Sunday, 9th August, with only one week of delay. At least I hope I will be finished by then.

For next week, I will completely focus on learning for my exam. I don't want to ever see a fucking statistics exercise in my life again and this module is the last one between me and this beautiful dream.

Also, here is the plant I mentioned yesterday:

![fat-mike](/assets/res/daily/day-86-fat-mike.jpg)

It's a *common butterwort*. In German it is called *Fettkraut*, which roughly translates to *fat herb*, so I named him *Fat Mike* after the bassist and founder of the record label *Fat Wreck Chords*. He likes to eat bugs ü§ì

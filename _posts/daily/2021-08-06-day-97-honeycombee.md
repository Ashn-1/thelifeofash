I never expected to be this unmotivated to write these posts, while being on vacation. Turns out my brain tries to take a vacation from everything. Well, not with me little brainy ðŸ¥´

Anyway, the weather was finally good, so we went on a little hike through a little marsh called *Zauberwald*. I really appreciate the effort that was put into decorating the marsh. There were statues carved out of wood all over the place &mdash; a wizard here, some giant mushrooms there and a little hut to rest in and eat something. All in all a worthwhile short walk through a cute little forest with a lot to see.

Also, our camping site is on a hill next to the *Titisee*, so the scenery from the entrance is beautiful

And finally, here is the drawing of today called *Honeycombee* (#415):

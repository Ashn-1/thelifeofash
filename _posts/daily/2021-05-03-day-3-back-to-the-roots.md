I'm still visiting a friend of mine and today we went to a nearby forest to walk there for a few hours. I was a little impressed by the tracks through the forest. Normally you have some wack trail or beaten track that vaguely resembles a path. Here the tracks were clearly visible and well made. Don't know why that impressed me; sometimes my head is weird.

Anyway, I love to walk or hike in the nature. I can just relax and my mind can calm down from whatever it is constantly occupied by. Nature is also a wonderful place to reflect; you are there in the forest just with yourself and there is nothing distracting you. I also feel like it gives me a new perspective on life outside of work, hobbies and friends; outside of the city life and the hecticness, the fast-paced life and the over-consumption of everything in modern life. Nature is just there and doesn't give a fuck about anything going on anywhere. It is just here. It just is. Nature is the definition of living in the here and now... And I love it.

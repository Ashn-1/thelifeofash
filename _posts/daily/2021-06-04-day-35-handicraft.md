In my opinion there are a handful of activities everyone needs in their life to live a fulfilled life. These activities include a physical, a mental, an expressive and a crafting activity. The amount of each activity that someone needs depends totally on each individual person. Some need a lot of physical activity and only occasionally need to express themselves; others are crafting things everyday, but only sometimes mentally exhaust themselves. However, today I just want to talk about the crafting activity and what I like to do.

I think that the act of physically building something is important for everyone. In contrast to the mental or expressive activity, the focus here lies within building something that is both physical (in contrast to poetry or thoughts) and also practical (in contrast to paintings or figurines). Of course there is some overlap between the different activities: you could build a practical piece of art and express yourself with it. But there is always some sort of focus on the project. It may be crafted and expressive, but the focus may lie within the usage of it afterwards and the process of crafting it, therefore making it a crafting activity.

Personally, this is a activity that I didn't really explore much. Currently I like to knit from time to time. I started to knit maybe a year ago and finished a first scarf back then and actually started to use it in the winter. After that I wanted to do a second colored scarf with a different pattern before moving to another kind of project, but I kinda got stuck with it. I still didn't finish it, but lately I've been working on it again. There are some more things I want to knit for myself in the future like a sweater and some socks. Some comfy, self-made clothes for the winter would be nice.

Other than knitting, I'd really like to get into woodworking. I was always fascinated by people who could take some pieces of wood and build a table, shelves or even a wardrobe, which actually looks way better than anything that you could buy at any store. I would love to get into it, but I currently just don't have the extra energy to put into exploring a new hobby. I also think that you probably need some more room for all the tools for woodworking. Obviously, that's is only partially true; I could start working on small projects that only need basic tools and little space, but hey, there has to be some excuse. At some point, I will definitely dive into woodworking and try it out for myself, maybe even in the near future... I may need a little shelve for my new plants.

Sidenote: Two days ago I forgot to post this beautiful picture of the sunset that I took while skating with some friends. Anyway here it is:

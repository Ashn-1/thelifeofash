Once upon a time, in 2019, I watched a video of Matt D'Avella on YouTube, where he announced he'd be doing a 30 day challenge each month for the entire year. There he also announced that one of the challenges would be cold showers. I wasn't that interested in doing cold showers, especially because some of the other challenges seemed more interesting for me personally. Also, I just love to take a long hot shower and just relax and wind down under the shower. Well, I wasn't interested in doing the cold shower challenge until Matt D'Avella said [I'm scared and a little bitch](https://youtu.be/Um6f90guss4?t=199).

I'm not gonna Matt just insult me like that, so I obviously got going and decided right there and then that I'm gonna do the cold shower challenge... well, that worked for just 3 days. After that I bitched out and took hot showers again. Last month, I wanted to tackle the cold showers again, but I chickened out again, while standing under the shower. But here we are again, third times the charm I heard, and so I'm going to take a cold shower every morning for the next 30 days... fuck my life, I already miss my hot showers...

Anyway, I'm excited to see how this will go. But regardless of whether or not I find a liking for cold showers, I will pull through this time and finish this goddamn challenge once and for all!

I went sightseeing the city with my cousin and their family today. At some point we got to a large place with a fountain in the middle. This one was on the same level as the ground, so you could technically walk through it. That is, if you don't mind getting completely wet in the process. I guess most adults wouldn't as much as dip their toes into the water and then have enough and go back. Good thing we have kids in this world that just don't give a fuck about anything. There were probably a dozen children running around in their underwear having fun and not caring about anything in the world. Sometimes, we as adults forget that we could learn a lot from children as well. And here the lesson is that we should not take ourselves so seriously and just enjoy life a little from time to time.

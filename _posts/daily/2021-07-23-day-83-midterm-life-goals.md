For the last few years I felt a little lost, not really knowing where I'm headed in my life. I always hear that you should have some goal you work towards in the next few years and I felt like I didn't have any. Neither did I really have the time or energy to work towards these things with work, university and friends taking up almost all of my time. And because I earned money at work and had a good time with my friends, I kinda hated university for preventing me from pursuing something that I actually wanted to do.

Ironic, isn't it? &mdash; After all, **I** am the person who wants to get this degree; it is **my** goal to finish university. No one forces me to do this and if I don't want to do this, I could just not do it. Btw, for the record, to anyone who thinks they have even the slightest say in what I do with my life: Go Fuck Yourself!

So, I guess I don't need any midterm life goal &mdash; because I already have one.

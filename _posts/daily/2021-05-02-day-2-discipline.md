Sometimes I wonder how wonderful my life would be if I had a little more discipline in my life. Just starting work on assignements or projects before the imminent deadline would make my life so much less stressful. But no, I somehow manage to start my commitment and throw it out the window practically the same day.

This weekend I am visiting a friend and staying with her, but instead of enjoying my time, I had to work on two assignements for university. It wasn't like I was sitting there the entire day and working instead of enjoying myself, but still I feel like I could've managed that a little better. I knew weeks in advance that I was going to visit her. I also knew weeks in advance that I had to finish the assignements. I feel like not being disciplined and organized enough takes away so much time I could spend to enjoy myself and do things I actually like. 

And no, I definitly didn't use the time I procrastinated for anything productive or enojoyable. I just sat there and wasted my time aimlessly.

That said, I got a lot better with discpline in the last few years. Hopefully this will continue in the future. I just want to get to the point where I am disciplined enough so I can waste a little time without feeling guilty af.

I never really thought much about my future; if you'd have asked my younger self what I wanted to be when I was older, I would have answered: "I don't know". However, my present self is now older and wiser, and I am also an adult now, so obviously the answer to that question is: "I have no fucking clue what I want to do with my life".

Still, somehow this aimless strolling through life never, not back when I was younger and neither now, made anxious. I never felt like I had to know what I wanted to do in life. I feel like I just realized from a young age that even most adults don't even know what they want to do, so how was I supposed to know.

Right now I just feel like I'm moving somewhere like a raft in a vast ocean. I don't know where the wind and the current will lead me, maybe to nowhere or into a storm, or maybe even to an island with free beer, I just don't know. Yet, somehow I'm just so excited to see where this journey is gonna take me and I'm gonna try to enjoy every moment that I spend on this wonderful raft.

My vacation laziness continues with another double post today.

Yesterday, we walked through the *Schlossgarten* in Stuttgart. The entire park has a length of approximately 5km and it takes about an hour to walk from one end to the other. I was really surprised to see such a large park be so beautiful. Normally with these parks, only a small part of it is well maintained and the rest usually resembles a jungle. Here, the entire park was well maintained and I really enjoyed to walk through its entirety and back.

Today, our vacation finally ended and we drove back home. I really enjoyed both camping in the *Schwarzwald* and visiting *Stuttgart*. I especially liked the abundance of nature and the hilly landscape of Stuttgart. I could definitely get used to living in a place that looks like that 😁

Anyway, even though I really enjoyed my vacation, I'm glad that I'm back and I actually really look forward to go back to work tomorrow 😬

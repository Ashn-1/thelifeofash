There are so many things I want to cover in these daily blogs, yet I push off writing the post until I'm too tired to get anything good done. Sometimes, it's a really good thought that I want to preserve for later, like when I want to write a post on [my main blog](https://thelifeofash.com). At least I started to write down my ideas now, just so I have them there, in case I'm actually motivated enough to write a proper post. 

I guess not every post can be a **Favorite** ðŸ’• post.

After a week of cold and rainy weather, today finally it got a little warmer and you know what that means: cycling until my legs feel like jelly. 

Cycling is my absolute favorite sport; it just has everything that I love in a sport: hurting muscles, speed and nature. I'm an avid cycler for probably around 15 years. Back then I started cycling everyday in summer with my cousin. Later on, when I moved to another city, I continued to cycle alone or take on long tours with a friend.

Besides the physical benefits, I also used cycling as an escape a lot. A few years ago I had a really shitty time in my life and I was feeling down a lot. At the same time I was sharing a room with my brother back then, so I couldn't even be alone, when I wanted to. So I decided to just go outside and be alone while cycling. That year I was cycling pretty much everyday for a month or two. I feel like it really helped me to get through those times.

I have some big milestones in my head for my cycling career that I want to tackle one by one over the next few years. Some of those are multi-day tours along some rivers or to some nearby cities. However, the biggest milestone I have set for myself is a long tour across Germany. I want to cycle from Oberstdorf to Flensburg, from the southern border with Austria to the northern border with Denmark. The tour is pretty much exactly 1000 km long, at least when you take the direct route and it would probably take around 2 weeks to complete. I need some more practice and at least some planning before I can start this adventure, but I'll aim to do this sometime next year.

I'm so excited that summer is coming now and I can finally cycle again!

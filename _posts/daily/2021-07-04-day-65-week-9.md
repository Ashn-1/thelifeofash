## Recap of Week 9

- âœ… **University** start watching lectures for first exam
- ðŸ”¶ **Blog** finish next blog post

## Focus for Week 10

- **Blog** publish next blog post
- **University** focus on finishing lectures for exam

I finally got around to start watching the lectures for my first exam. I finished the first two and have two more to go. I don't know why, but my professor just did a few lecture that are 4 hours long each. I'm not sure why he didn't just split them up into more manageable pieces. Anyway, two more lectures should be doable and I want to primarly focus on finishing this and learning for the exam next Friday. That one should hopefully not be that difficult.

As for the blog post, I just finished writing the post, however, I need to proofread it and maybe edit some parts, so I don't want to release it today. I'm going to finish the post tomorrow and then publish it. After postponing it for a month, it finally is time to actually finish it... Hopefully my next post will not be delayed so much.

Like I mentioned in [Day 135]({% post_url daily/2021-09-12-day-135-week-19 %}), I want to merge my main blog with my daily entries and also implement the entire website myself. Just now, I finished migrating all my blog posts from wordpress to Markdown. Now I can display all the posts and their content properly in the format of this daily entry.

While it was tedious at times, I really enjoyed the process. I had to figure out ways to simplify and automate the writing aspect of the website; like using image sliders, images with captions, adding audio or video players or just the layout of the content; while still maintaining readability of the source file, where I'm writing the posts in.

Also, I now got a glimpse at how complex web-design can be and I feel like I can now appreciate a good website even more.

My next step is to actually design the website and figure out how I want to display all the different content on my website. I always dreaded designing a user interface for tools I implemented at work or games I programmed, but for those it was enough to just be functional to get to the good stuff. The user interface of my website has to also look good in addition to having good content. However, I'm kinda looking forward to designing the website, as it poses a new challenge for myself from which I can improve a lot üòÅ

I started to knit some socks &mdash; I mean how hard can this be, right? Well, turns out that knitting socks takes a long time, if you're not very fast ðŸ¥´ Also, that is for one single sock, if I actually want a pair, then I guess I have to work full-time on that...

I mean, I'm complaining, but I like knitting so I don't really have a problem with putting the time into it. Unless I finish the first sock and realize it's too small or big for my feet. Then I'm gonna burn that sock to the ground ðŸ”¥

Some time ago, a friend of mine asked me what personality trait I admire the most in other people. Somehow this question was very hard for me to find an answer to. Admitting that I'd like to have something someone else has, was always quite hard for me; that'd be admitting to being imperfect and thus a weakness, right? So I answered by not answering the question and talking out of my ass about how I don't admire other people for their traits.

Well, I think I found the answer to that question: I admire people who are unapologetically themselves. People who can express themselves; people who show themselves to the world without being embarassed; people who are just the way they are without hiding.

In many situations it feels so wrong to just be myself, to just be a little emotional, or talk about the things that fascinate or entertain me. Sometimes it's just hard to be myself &mdash; and that, sometimes, tears me apart on the inside.

I feel like *myself* is old enough now to go out into the world on his own without me protecting him.  
I think it's time to let him go and be free...

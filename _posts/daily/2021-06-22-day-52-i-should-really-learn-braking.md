[Day 28]({% post_url daily/2021-05-28-day-28-still-didn-t-learn-to-brake %}): 'Oh and also, I still donâ€™t know how to properly brake with my board. I kinda just hope that no one runs in front of my board when I have more speed and that cars actually stop when they donâ€™t right of way. **I should definitely learn how to brake next.** Oh well, â€¦'

24 days later and I still can't brake.

Today, I went out with friends and afterwards we cruised around their neighborhood a little. Most of the streets and paths there were pretty nice to cruise on. But then, we got to a street that had a super nice and flat ground and went slightly downwards. I saw that there is a curve at the end of the street, but figured that I have enough way to naturally slow down at the end, because the street went from downward to even there. 

I was wrong, the street did not, in fact, go even at the end; it was a downhill until the very end of the street. So there I am on my board taking up speed and feeling great, when I realize that I get very close to the curve and am still going at full speed. I tried to lean into the curve, but I also cannot really take curves when going at high speeds. So I jump off the board, get on the ground and I'm running with full speed until I get to a halt.

Meanwhile my board perfectly drives towards the only parking car in a 10 meter radius. It went underneath the car and hit the curbside of the pavement with full speed and then slowly went back out the underside of the car the way it came. I thought the griptape of the tail must have scraped the car somehow and left damage, but miraculously there was only dust on the side of the car and not scrapes.

At this point, my friends are looking at me in disbelief of how stupid I am and my legs are shaking like jelly. They thought I'm gonna smoothly take off some speed my carving, foot braking or sliding or whatever, instead I'm just an idiot with a board ðŸ˜¬

Anyway, today was a great day, but I really need to learn how to brake, first with slower speeds and then on downhills. I'd rather try to brake and fall on my face than to not be in control of my board whatsoever ðŸ˜¨

Let's see if I actually learn to brake in the next 24 days...

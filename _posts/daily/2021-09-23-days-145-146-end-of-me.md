Music tip: *End of Me* by *Billy Talent*

The song is about a relationship that you know is not good for yourself. Someone that is dragging you down and will inevitably be the *end of you*.

I really dig the song and have been listening to it nonstop for the past two days. Besides the fact that it sounds awesome, I can also somewhat identify with the person in this song being dragged down by a bad influence in their life. So I have been wondering who this bad influence might be in my life.

Turns out that the answer is very obvious: I am that person. I am the one talking shit and dragging myself down. Making the same mistakes and complaining why I'm not making any progress in life. Somehow **I** am the person that will be the *end of me*.

The common remedy for a toxic relationship is to cut that person out of your life. So what are you supposed to do, if that person is you? &mdash; can't be cutting off yourself from your own life... I think ðŸ¤”

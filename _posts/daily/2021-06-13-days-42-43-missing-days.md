Kinda missed two days in a row... Whoops ðŸ˜…

I have a specific setup for how I publish these posts and for that I need to be at my PC at home or have my laptop with me. So, if I'm too tired to write a post at night and push it to the next day and then get up and immediately get out to meet other friends and then do a spontaneous sleepover, well then my daily entries are gonna be late. I probably need to find a way to publish posts from my phone ðŸ¤”

Anyway, I had some nice time with friends the last two days. I also had another meeting with the supervisor of my term paper. The deadline for my first finished draft is up next week and I should definitely get going and write as much as I can every day. That's gonna fun... Yeah ðŸ˜µ

Also, I kinda feel like doing a little bit of a wardrobe makeover and finding a style that fits me as person as opposed to my current looking-as-plain-as-possible-to-be-as-inoffensive-as-I-can' look. Recently, I've been trying to find my own personality and try to be me as much as I can. I was and still am afraid of doing so, but I feel like it is time for me to get out there and show the world that I exist, rather than hiding behind a tree to not get hurt by the rocks that are thrown around by the big, bad world. It's time to get up and throw some rocks at the world too. It's time to become the [main character of my own life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiQtjW2tEyc) instead of being an NPC.

It's time for me ðŸ˜Ž

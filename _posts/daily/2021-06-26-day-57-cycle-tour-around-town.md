I went on a bicycle tour today with a friend. The planning was, as always, completely on point. We aimed at doing 50 km, then planned 65 km and ended up doing 80 km. I do not have the slightest clue as to where the extra kilometers came from. I mean, yes, we did go the wrong way here and there and had to backtrack, but nowhere near 15 kilometers of extra way ðŸ¤”

Some stats of our tour:

<table class="table-vertical">
    <tr><th>Time</th><td>3:55 hours</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Distance</th><td>81.4 km</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Avg. Speed</th><td>20.8 km/h</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Max. Speed</th><td>50 km/h</td></tr>
</table>

Anyway, it was a great tour and I enjoyed the cycling and the pain in every single part of my body. Somehow this kind of pain is great, you know you did something good for yourself, explored the nearby towns and had a great time with a friend. What else do you want in a good day? Maybe a banana milkshake... I'd love to have one now ðŸ˜‹

Sometimes I'm so focused on myself that I forget that all the other people out there are humans too. Humans with their own problems and struggles, their own hopes and dreams. This includes all the people that I dislike and like, all my collegues, all the people I so dearly love and all the people I don't know even exist. 

Somehow, we're all just drifting through life; most people don't even knowing where they are drifting. And yet we all feel so alone in our journey through the unknown; none of these people could possibly understand how I feel, right? To be honest, I think that they all can understand me and we all understand you. 

Sometimes we just need to reach out and ask: can you feel me?  
Sometimes we just need to reach out and say: I feel you.

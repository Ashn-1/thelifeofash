Hello there,

I guess it's time to see what I managed to finish from my ToDo list. Well, it doesn't look that great ðŸ˜¬

First of all, I neither finished the two chapters I wanted to finish for my thesis, nor did I watch all lectures and exercises for my upcoming exams. But I did watch some lectures and even started the exercises today and I also wrote one of the two chapters for my thesis. So I'm not completely off ðŸ¤” At least, I've managed to learn the song I set out to learn, so there goes that.

My exam is next week, so I will be focusing on that for this week. Also, until the end of march I will be predominantly occupied with finishing my thesis.

## Recap of Week 26

- ðŸ”¶ **Exam** finish watching all lectures and exercises
- ðŸ”¶ **Thesis** finish the Related Works and Theory section of the thesis
- âœ… **Bass** learn _Fallen Leaves_ by Billy Talent

## Focu of Week 27

- **Exam** learn for the upcoming exam
- **Thesis** finish the Theory chapter of the thesis

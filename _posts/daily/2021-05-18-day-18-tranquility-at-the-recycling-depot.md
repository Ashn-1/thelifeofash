Me and my brother renovated our rooms over the last few weeks and months and as a result we had to throw away some of the old furniture. In true student flat fashion, we put off throwing away the furniture away for some weeks and accumulated everything in our living room. In the end, it was filled with probably two dozen wooden planks, two mattresses, two bed frames and a bunch of cartons, plastic and metal garbage.

After ignoring the problem for some weeks, we finally decided to get a van, throw everything in there and bring it to the recycling depot â™». And I have to say: I really like the atmosphere at the recycling depot. It's just so relaxed there. Everyone brings their garbage there, carries it to the designated container and throws the stuff in there. The people there are also super chill and always helping you out with anything you need. The entire place just has a very layed back feeling and I feel very tranquil throwing my stuff away there. An oasis of tranquility in a big and loud city. I love it! ðŸ’—

Also I saw a double rainbow today! ðŸŒˆðŸŒˆ

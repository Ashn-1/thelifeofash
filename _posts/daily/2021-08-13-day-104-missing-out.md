So, one of my coworkers invited the entire team for a barbecue at her place. Obviously, I wanted to participate in it, eat some grilled meat, and drink some beer with everyone. So I accepted the invititation. Some days later I realized that on this day my cousin and her family come to visit us. Admittedly, they want to stay the entire weekend anyway, so I could still go there, right?

Well, technically yes, but I'd have to prepare and clean everything beforehand &mdash; which I didn't do. 

Also, I accepted the invitation of my cousin to accompany them on their vacation for the first day. I have to work, so I only have one day to go with them. However, I'd really like a day for myself to chill out and recharge a little.

I fear to miss out on fun and exciting things thinking I will be a castout, if I don't somehow sacrifice my time for the group. I will make time and squeeze myself in between different social events and activities for the sake of the group, only to be crushed by it mentally. 

So I just cancelled on both the barbecue at my coworkers place and the one day vacation with my cousin's family.

**I <u>will not</u> stress myself out for nothing anymore.**

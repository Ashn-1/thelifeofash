Today was one of those days where I felt completely tired for the entire day. I didn't do much at all today, definitely not as much as I had planned to do, and yet I feel like I just climbed a mountain.

Well, I learned to just take these days slowly and not stress too much about it. Nothing unusual to just feel like not doing anything sometimes.

Anyway, a week or so ago I made some muffins with a friend. After the first batch was finished, we went to the living room and ate something and talked for a while. Then I wanted to go to the bathroom and noticed a faint burned smell in the hallway. Turns out, we forgot to take out the second batch of muffins. They were so hard and black, you would have thought they were coal.

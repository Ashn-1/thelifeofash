In [Day 45]({% post_url daily/2021-06-14-day-45-being-overwhelmed %}) I talked about how I like to go for a walk when I feel bad. Well, today was another one of those days. I don't know what exactly the problem was, but I felt a little crushed. So, when nighttime came around and I still felt bad, I got up and went for a walk. 

At this point it was already raining, but it wasn't too bad. I walked around for 5 minutes and realized the wind is getting stronger and the rain is starting to pour. I decided to go for a shorter walk and turn at the next street and go back home. Oh boy, it fucking poured down on me, when I reached the end of the street.

My shoes and legs were already soaked, but I luckily took my umbrella with me. So I'm on my way back, running through deep puddles of water on every street corner, when I turn at another street. The wind suddenly hit me and my umbrella from the other side. My umbrella just disintegrated and now I'm standing there without an umbrella getting fucking soaked. The rain was just pouring and I could barely see anything. So I decided to run home. Luckily, I wasn't that far away from home and got there in like 2 minutes.

My sweater was so soaked it felt like it weighted 20 kg. What a way to end the day. Anyway, after that incredible experience I felt better and went on to play some games with friends.

Kinda bad day, but felt great in the rain. I should probably get soaked more often.

Btw, my umbrella:

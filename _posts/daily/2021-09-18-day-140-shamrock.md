It's funny how we sometimes don't realize that we missed something until we do it again. I often have this with certain activities like swimming or cycling &mdash; I don't find the time or the motivation to do them for some time and then I get back to it and I remember why I loved doing them so much.

Well, I had this today with going to a bar with a friend. We went to an irish pub and drank some pitchers here and there. Also, it was karaoke night and I screamed every song I knew as loud as I possible could. It was nice just sitting there amongst other people and feeling the vibe of the bar, the laughs, the broken glasses, the energy, and the occasional drama.

Somehow, over the year and a half of COVID, I forgot how much I enjoyed doing these bar trips. Well, I guess it is time to whip out my the ol' reliable liver and make it work a little more again ðŸ¥´  
Or at least with some moderation ðŸ˜¬

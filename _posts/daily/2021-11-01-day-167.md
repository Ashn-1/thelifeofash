Sometimes, when rambling about all the things that went wrong in our lives, my friend asks me, whether I think other people are as broken as we are. My answer was always *yes*. Of course we are not the only ones, everyone got something going on in their life, which makes them miserable from time to time. And somtimes that includes a total mental breakdown.

However, over time my perspective has shifted. Does it really matter if other people are feeling shitty too? Somehow I attached my own brokenness to other peoples brokenness. I understand that knowing that other people are feeling the same way as oneself does can help. However, this attachement also leads to some major problems &mdash; what if all the people you can relate to suddenly moved on and didn't have that problem anymore? What if you cannot find anyone with the same problems as yourself? What are you going to do now?

Seems like a situation that a lot of us might find themselves in. And I want to clarify, I don't mean to say that you shouldn't find people with the same problems as yourself. Find them and help each other, it's a great thing. I'm just saying that you're problems are valid, even if there is no one else sharing your fate.

You're not broken ðŸ’•

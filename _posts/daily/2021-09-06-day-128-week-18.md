## Recap of Week 18

- ðŸ”¶ **Morning Routine** wake up at 7am on workdays

## Focus for Week 19

- **Thesis** start working on the thesis
- **Blog** think about a topic for the upcoming blog post

So, I didn't actually wake up at 7am every day, however, I managed to be at work everyday at around 8am, which I'll take as a victory nonetheless. I'd still like to wake up a little earlier, but as long as I'm at work at 8am, I'm quite happy.

For next week, I want to start working on my thesis. I have to read some related papers and start gathering some relevant data. I really don't want the procrastination to take over here, otherwise the beginning of next year will be hell for me... and I really don't want to be that stressed out.

Also, I want to start working on blog posts concerning specific topics with more research. I will upload one update post until next week, however, the next major post will be next month on the first Sunday. I know I have been saying this for some time now, but I'm actually motivated to get something done here. I really want to start writing for myself again.

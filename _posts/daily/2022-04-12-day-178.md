Oh man, it's been a while...

I'm not sure if the weekly/monthly reviews are something that I want to follow through currently. Somehow, I managed to finish my university degree (or rather I will be finishing it in the next few weeks) and I did not figure out what I actually want to do with my life. So I'm currently in somewhat of a self-finding phase, although I'm not even sure myself what that entails.

Also, I want to write a little more in these daily posts and maybe even start to write some bigger blog posts again. I feel like this might help me figure things out in my life. Or maybe not, but that would be progress too, right? Right 😁

Let's see what the future brings... I hope it's something beautiful 🌻

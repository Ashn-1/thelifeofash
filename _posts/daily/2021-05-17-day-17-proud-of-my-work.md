Obviously I'm proud of everything I post on my blog and here on my journal. But am I proud enough of it to promote it to the world? Hell no, I'm a little bitch when it comes to promoting the things I create. This stands in stark contrast to what I, as an artist, want: my creations to be seen by as many people as possible. 

And so, to combat this, I created accounts on various social medias to promote my work. That was a month ago and I stalled so hard before doing anything on it. To be honest, I would have stalled even further and maybe never even posted anything there, if there wouldn't have been a little incident today. I went on my Instagram and checked the three new posts I had in my feed after a day of not visiting. And there it was, a friend of mine promoted her blog. To be honest, that one came out of nowhere and I was a little proud to see that. And then I was pissed at myself; why can't I do that for my posts? What am I even afraid of? I am proud of my posts and all the work I put into them, so fuck my anxiety, I'm gonna put my work out there! And so I took my anxiety for a walk to my local park, punched it unconscious and fed that bastard to the evil ducks living there.

A lot of words to say that I posted on my Instagram and promoted my blog. Also, to that friend, because I know you are reading this: thank you for giving me that little push I needed, you are truly an inspiration for me ðŸ˜Š

Also, here is her blog: [mzaggy](https://mzaggy.wordpress.com/). Go have a look, it's awesome!

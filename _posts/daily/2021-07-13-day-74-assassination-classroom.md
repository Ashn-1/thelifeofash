I started watching an anime called *Assassination Classroom* a few weeks ago. The premise of the anime is pretty simple: a class full of middle school students has to kill their teacher until the end of the school year. Oh, and the teacher is an extremely powerful and fast octopus-like being. Yeah same, what the fuck, right? Anyway, I gave it a shot and watched the first episode... and I got hooked instantly. 

The characters are very well done and likeable, the story is completely wack - just how I like it, and the overall length is pretty short - only 2 seasons Ã  ~20 episodes. I gotta say, I really enjoyed watching *Assassination Classroom* and I may or may not have cried during some of the last scenes of the anime ðŸ˜­

I highly recommend giving it a shot ðŸ˜Š

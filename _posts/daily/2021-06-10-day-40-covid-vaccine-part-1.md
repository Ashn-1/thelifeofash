Today I got the first part of my COVID vaccine. The second is scheduled in six weeks, so I still have some time before I'm a free man again, i.e. I don't need a negative test anymore ðŸ˜¬ Besides some mild to medium pain in my arm, I currently don't have any other side-effects from the vaccine, let's see if this changes over the next few days.

The doctor's office, where I got my vaccine, was at the airport here in Munich and everyone was so friendly there. I'm just not used to doctor's and their staff being anything but cold or just straight up assholes. Probably explains why I never go to the doctor ðŸ¤”

Sidenote: I took my curiserboard to the airport and damn, was that ground nice to cruise over. If it wouldn't be that far away, I'd explore the airport a little more with my board. Well, maybe someday, when all other options are exhausted...

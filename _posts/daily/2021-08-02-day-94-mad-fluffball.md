I had my last exam of the semester today and I'm finally free! üòÅ The exam went alright I guess and I hope that I'm gonna pass it, but other than that I'm just glad that I'm done for now.

Also, for August I wanted to draw something everyday and I decided to draw Pok√©mon based on description only. This is inspired by a Twitch streamer I watch from time to time called [Carson Drew It](https://www.twitch.tv/carsondrewit). The descriptions are kinda vague so I don't instantly know which Pok√©mon it is. My brother gives me these descriptions each day and I have until the end of the day to complete a little drawing.

Admittedly, my drawing skills of even somewhat realistic things are non-existent, but maybe that changes over the course of the thirty days. And if not, I will at least have 30 awesome pieces of whacky art ü§ì

Here is todays artwork called 'Mad Fluffball' (#057).

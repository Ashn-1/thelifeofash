Today was a beautiful and sunny day ðŸ˜Ž

In the evening, after finishing up my term paper work, I took my skateboard and a book and went to the local park. I tried to search a spot to chill a little on the grass, but the entire place was full of duck shit. Fuck you ducks!

Anyway, after some searching I found a nice place and sat down to read a little and enjoy the sun. Also, the view was fantastic:

On another note, I bought a helmet for cycling and skating some weeks ago. However, everytime I went out to skate or cycle, I either forgot to take the helmet with me or I was too self-conscious to actually wear it. Then, I saw some videos of Andy Anderson, a pro-skater, who wears a helmet, without fail, everytime he goes skating. In another video he stressed the importance of wearing a helmet and how he wants to be a role model for other people and that he wants to make it more acceptable to actually wear a helmet, instead of people teasing you for caring about your safety.

I really liked his attitude towards the whole helmet thing and, to be honest, if people actually judge me for caring about my safety, they can go eat duck shit.

So, I'll stop letting my worries of being judged affect my safety, when doing things I love to do. Especially because I want to do this for as long as I can and a helmet might save me one day from losing all this.

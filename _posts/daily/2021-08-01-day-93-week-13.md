## Recap of Week 13

- üî∂ **University** learn your ass off for the next exam, so you can finally be done with statistics for the rest of your life

## Focus for Week 14

- **Blog** finish blog post about doing yoga for a month until next week Sunday
- **Relax** take some time off and do whatever I want to do

I did study for my exam pretty much everyday the last week. Was it optimal? Nope. Could I have done more? Technically yes, but fuck that; I did exactly as much as I could without going mental. Let's just see how the exam tomorrow goes; and whatever happens, I'm gonna be done with exams for this semester üò¨

For next week, I want to finish my post about my July challenge of doing yoga everyday. I feel like this post is gonna be a bit shorter, because there is not much to tell here.

Besides the post I just want to relax and do whatever I want to do on each given day. I'm going on vacation next week and I just want to recharge a little, both physically and mentally. I'm already excited for next week üòÅ

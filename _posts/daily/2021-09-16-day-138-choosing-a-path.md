I have to decide in which team I want to continue to work in at work. I feel like the pros and cons of both teams are very balanced, which makes the decision somewhat difficult. 

I mean, I have to decide on something that will have an effect on my intermediate future. That feels kinda frightening and as a result it is hard to make a decision. But to be honest, what is the worst that will happen? If I realize that I don't feel the team I chose anymore, I can just switch to the other one. 

I feel like most decisions in life are like this. I tend to worry about all the different ways my decision might go wrong. All the things I might miss out on. I could instead just be excited for all the possibilities that might come with my decision and try to see the positives. 

Well yeah, *just be positive*, easier said than done. But hey, you gotta start somewhere, right?

I'll try to make the best decision with what information I currently have. And if I fuck up any decision in my life, well then there is nothing else to do other than to laugh about it and move on.

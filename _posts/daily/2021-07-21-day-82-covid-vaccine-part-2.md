Today, I got my second COVID vaccine. I heard from others that the second shot might result in a day or two of misery (or mild fever symptoms as they are called by others). Currently, I feel fine and only have mild pain in my arm around the spot, where I got the shot. Let's see how I feel tomorrow; I feel like tomorrow is either gonna be a really shitty or really great day.

Oh and also here is a picture I took today. I sometimes walk past this building, but I just don't know what it's purpose was or currently is. What I can say is that it looks cool during dusk and creepy and haunted during the night:

Sometimes, I have these days where everything is slow. You do some things and then chill for the rest of the day without doing anything. 

Somehow, when I have these kinds of days, it still feels like I'm wasting my life away. After work I just ate something and watched an anime until it got dark outside. At least that's how my mind sees this day, completely disregarding the fact that I worked today and then went grocery shopping and made an awesome salad (hell yeah). It's crazy to me how much my mind works against me sometimes...

I should probably learn to tame my **mind** and control *it*, instead of letting *it* control me &mdash; aka I should stop skipping meditation and yoga and get a little more **mind**fullness into my life.

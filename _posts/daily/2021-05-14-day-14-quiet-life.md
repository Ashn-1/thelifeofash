I met with friends today and we had a nice and relaxing evening together. Ate a little and then went on a walk to the nearby park for a beer. On the way there we saw a lot of teenagers, drinking and singing with loud music blaring. No, I'm not going to complain about the kids of today like the old man that I am. I just saw them and I remembered the good old  times before COVID. Back then I often went drinking with friends. Those were fun times, but I kinda enjoy my quiet life today. Everything feels slowed down. Don't get me wrong, from time to time I wish I could do one of those 7 beers and a kebap night out with friends, but overall I'd rather keep my quiet life. I was just wondering whether I ever enjoyed this or if I was just participating to be with my friends. I don't really know.

Nowadays, I often take a walk with friends, or we go on a hike, or we cook something together, or we drink a beer or two and talk about life. From time to time I have some more action-packed days with more drinking and being loud and everything. I like it. Thank you COVID... I guess ðŸ¤”

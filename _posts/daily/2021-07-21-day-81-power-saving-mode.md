You know that moment when your phone got like 14% battery left and you put it into energy saving mode, because you need the phone to get you through the rest of the day?

I sometimes feel like my brain puts my body into energy saving mode. I'm tired, I don't want to do anything, and I'm unproductive at work. I guess I forgot to re-charge myself... whoops ðŸ¥´ Anyway, I guess there is not much left to do other than to just rest and blast my brain with YouTube videos.

On a sidenote: I recently started watching the YouTube channel [NotJustBikes](https://www.youtube.com/c/NotJustBikes), who makes videos about urban planning and urban experiences and shows good and bad examples of how this can look like. I really like his ideas about car-independent cities and suburbs, where everything for the everyday life is reachable by public transport, bicycle or walking.

Back at the beginning of the month I visited a friend. Her roommate just newly got a pennyboard and we also tried it out. Though I didn't spend much time on the board to actually learn how to cruise around, I really enjoyed it and so I decided to buy a board for myself. In the end, I decided to buy a cruiserboard with my brother and split the cost between us. This way both of us could try it out and if both of us liked it we could still buy another one (which we'll probably do now 😏).

Today, I went to the local park with my new board and I cruised around there from one end to the other and back. I did not get very far each time I hopped on the board and after a few meters I had to get off, because my balance was completely wack 🥴. However, after some rounds I got the hang of it and managed to cruise for longer distances; nothing too special, but I made some progress. Even without crusing much around the city and just doing basic skating, I just have to say: I love it 💕 

I'm really excited to put some time into this and learn how to properly cruise around, so that I can get farther and farther. I'd love to just use my cruiserboard to get around town, instead of using public transport or my bike. It's just more convenient and flexible with a cruiserboard.

So, I think I found a new hobby 🛹

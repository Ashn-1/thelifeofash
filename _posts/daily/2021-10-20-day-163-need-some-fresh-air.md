Recently, I've been really into knitting as a hobby, as you could guess by the number of posts regarding it in recent times. I actually bought some more wool yesterday and now the shelf with all my knitting stuff is overflowing and I need to expand my knitting space in my room.

Anyway, while I really enjoy knitting, it also cuts back the time I spend outside. A lot of my hobbies are usually activities that I can do outside, like cycling, skating, or that I need to get to by going outside, like kendo. But the combination of approaching autumn, my laziness and the fact that I'm knitting a lot at my desk at home led to me not getting enough fresh air and movement.

And I can already feel that in my body: my back aches after sitting for hours, my legs are tired after walking for a little bit and I feel a little tired all the time. I really feel like that comes from the lack of movement that my body is usually used to.

So, I want to do something outside everyday. At the very least, I want to spend some time outside just walking for like half an hour; at best, I want to cycle more often again, go running, or start swimming again. I really miss doing endurance sport &mdash; that was always something that I was looking forward to in my life 😓

And with that, I'm going to do a little night walk now 🏃🏽‍♂️

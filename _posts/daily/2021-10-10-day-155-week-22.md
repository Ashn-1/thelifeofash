So, I took a week off from writing posts, which was kinda decided spontaneously on Wednesday after not writing anything for three days. Well, you know how it goes, sometimes I just don't feel like it ðŸ˜¬

Anyway, I'm back and I am going to stick to this daily thing for at least until I reach the 200 day mark. Afterwards, I'm gonna decide how I want to continue these brain dump posts.

As for the focus of the week, I'm gonna ignore the ones I set two weeks ago and focus on the next week:

## Focus of Week 23

- **Yoga** do some yoga again; find the best time in a day to do yoga
- **Website** design the frontpage of my blog

Well, see ya tomorrow then ðŸ˜Š  
Ash

Today, I cruised around half the town and I had a blast. I wanted to meet a friend at the university and so I used that as a excuse skate. But instead of directly going there, I took a detour to the nearby park.However, that park is in no way on the way to the university, but at least it had really nice paths to cruise on.

Anyway, after cruising through smaller and bigger street and on the pavement, I think I got a lot more secure on the board. There is still a lot to improve, but I can get from A to B with my board regardless if I know the way or not, which is nice.

Besides cruising around as much as I can, I want to focus a bit more on handling of the board by learning some 'tricks'. I don't want to learn tricks to look fancy, but rather to move around the town without getting off my board constantly to cross streets or take sharper turns... and a little bit to just look cool, I just can't deny that.

Oh and also, I still don't know how to properly brake with my board. I kinda just hope that no one runs in front of my board when I have more speed and that cars actually stop when they don't right of way. I should definitely learn how to brake next. Oh well, ...

Anyway, I really enjoy skating right now.

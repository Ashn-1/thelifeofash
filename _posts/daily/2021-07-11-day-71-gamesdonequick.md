Today is the final day of [Summer Games Done Quick](https://gamesdonequick.com/) and the last run has just ended. They finishsed this year off with Kingdom Hearts 2 and reached 2.9 million dollars in donations!

Games Done Quick (GDQ) is a bi-annual event, where they speedrun games and collect donations for specific organizations. In January during Awesome Games Done Quick, they collect donations for the [Prevent Cancer Foundation](https://www.preventcancer.org/), and in July during the Summer Games Done Quick, they collect donations for [Doctors Without Borders](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/). Both events feature older and newer games with really entertaining runs. It's always funny to see how they manage to break a game in order to achieve a faster time.

The runners and the commentators provide hilarious and informative commentary and make every game a blast to watch. I don't even know most of the games, but the entertainment factor is just so great that it doesn't even matter.

It's also astounding, time and time again, how much money they manage to raise over the course of the week. Their alltime high record was set in 2020 during the AGDQ event in January with a total donation count of **$3,164,002**! I just think it's incredible to see the people at GDQ having so much fun doing the things they love and also helping a good cause üòÅ

I'm looking forward to the next big event in January with AGDQ2022 and I hope they manage to do this for a long time coming üòä

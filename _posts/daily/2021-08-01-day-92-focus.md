I thought a little about my weekly recaps that I do on every Sunday. It felt a little odd to me, whenever I put something as the focus of the next week that had a deadline, like this week, when I put 'Learning for my upcoming exam'. Obviously I **have** to do this, right? So if I have to do this anyway, I will be forced to focus on it anyway. Dunno, somehow I felt like these things don't belong there.

Then again, nothing of consequence is going to happen, if I don't write it; I actually **don't** have to write it, but rather can if I want to. So putting it as the focus for my week makes perfect sense. It also transforms it from a 'I have to do this' to a 'I want to do this', which helps with the motivation.

Anyway, I'm glad when this is all over and I have a little more time for doing other things. I also want to figure out a sideproject for the time between after the exam and the start of my thesis. I want to create something, although I'm not quite sure what it is yet ðŸ¤”

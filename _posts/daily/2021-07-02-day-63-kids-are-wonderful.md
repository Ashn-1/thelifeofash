I went skating today with my brother. We went to a nearby office building and trained some tricks. The ground in front of these office buildings is perfect for skating: newly build and smooth. 

Anyway, we just arrived there and started to do some tricks, when a group of three kids passed us. One of them shouted 'Do an Ollie!'. I'm new  to skating, so I can't do anything nearly that impressive. So I shouted back 'I'm a beginner, I can't do that!'. I expected some dumb comment so he could look cool in front of his friends. He deadass looked at me and said 'If you keep training, you can make it!'.

I did not expect to get words of encouragement from that kid. Fuck, if that kid believes in me, then I should start to believing in myself, too 😁

Thank you random kid for believing in me! 😊

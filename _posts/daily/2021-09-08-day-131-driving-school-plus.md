For work I had to do some mandatory special driving lessons that are specifically for driving test vehicles. Today I had my first of three lessons and got throught without any major problems. I really had a blast driving today üòÅ

Anyway, that's not really what I want to talk about. Today, I again realized a little bit that I can indeed be social with some people I've never met. I had a partner with whom I shared the car with for the entire day that I didn't know before and yet, I had a fun time with him. We talked a little, gave each other feedback, pushed and praised each other, and we were all around a good team. 

Also, I talked to another guy during the lunch break after nervously sitting around for five minutes and being a little bitch. He actually works at the same company as me and, while I don't know him, I had some contact with his supervisor and knew where he was working.

I know these are not the kind of stories, where I get out of myself and find some new best friends like some people manage to do it all the time. But it shows me that I am not completely socially inept. At least not as much as I thought I am üòÅ

## Recap of Week 4

- üî∂ **University** do I actually dare to put this here after failing it twice? Hell yeah!
- üî∂ **Music** I am going to commit to practicing and making music every day!

## Plan for Week 5

- **University** focus on writing my term paper

I didn't do much for university this week, but at least I did something. I watched some lectures and also started to write my term paper; maybe a little too late for my liking, but hey, at least I started.

As for music, I did play every day, but not very enthusiastically. I want to do much more with music, but currently I just don't have the creative energy. So I'll try to maintain my skill and learn a few songs, instead of letting my skill deteriorate and then, when I feel the creative energy, I can barely play anymore and have to get up to speed again. So I'll continue what I'm already doing and playing at least a little bit everyday.

For next week, I will focus fully on my term paper and nothing else. I really have to get this going, because the deadline is in two weeks already. I could push it back one or two week, but I'd rather not and just finish it in time, so next week will be dedicated to writing my term paper ‚úçüèº

Also, I want to get some kind of board to hang on my wall. I'd like to pin the focus of each week to this board, so that my goal is always in sight, instead of buried in my last weekly recap entry. I'll update you, whenever I have it.

Also, I was skating today and I somehow got out of town next to a canola field:

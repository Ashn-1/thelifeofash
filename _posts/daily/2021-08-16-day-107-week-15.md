## Recap of Week 15

- ‚ùå **Blog** finish blog post about doing yoga for a month

## Focus for Week 16

- **Blog** and another round of finishing this goddamn blog post ü•¥
- **Morning Routine** start doing yoga before work in the morning

Yeah, I didn't work on my next blog post at all. My week was kinda busy and I had guests, so there wasn't much time to work on anything, let alone rest for a second. I feel like I should reserve one day a week for just chilling and not doing anything in particular. Maybe every Sunday? Dunno, I'll think about it.

As for next week, I will, once again, try to finish this blog post. I'll try to work on it everyday for a little bit.

Also, I want to do yoga in the morning before work again. Before, I always did yoga after waking up, however, I didn't work at the time and studied for my exams, so it was easy to wake up at like 8 or 9 and do some yoga. Now that I have to wake up at 7, its hard to be motivated to do anything. But I really want to establish yoga as a morning routine for myself. I feel like it's gonna have a positive impact on the rest of my day.

To be honest, there was nothing much to talk about yesterday and today. I went to work, met with a friend, slept, went to work again and then watched YouTube and Twitch until now.

Also, I didn't really feel like writing or doing anything in particular. I guess my body is still recovering from the [hike I did two days ago]({% post_url daily/2021-09-19-days-141-142-week-20-and-hiking-tour %}). 

By now I think that these slow days are just part of my life. Rather than fight against or feel bad for myself for not doing anything crazy, I just accept that this is the case. Now, whether this is the correct way to handle this or not, that  I do not know, but if it starts to feel like the wrong thing than I'm gonna change something. Until then, this seems like the right thing for me.

Anyway, here is a cow from my hike two days ago:

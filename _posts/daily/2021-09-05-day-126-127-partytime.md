So, I went to a barbecue with some of my colleagues from work. Damn, that was a fun experience... and maybe me and another colleague got a little plastered ðŸ¥´

Anyway, I had a blast and it was definitely worth the hangover I had the next day. Well, kinda at least. Let's say I was dying the entire day and me and my brother had to postpone visiting our relatives to the next day ðŸ˜¬

On a more serious note, I sometimes have the feeling that I'm not really welcome at social events, because my presence wouldn't add any value. The good old classic of 'I'm too boring and don't have anything to contribute' kinda thing. But going to these events makes me realize that I do indeed add value, in my own weird way &mdash; and that's probably how it should be.

Oh and also, I should probably stop doing these 2 day recaps and go to daily entries again. Otherwise I have to change the name of this journal ðŸ¤”

So, yesterday nothing special happened. I just had a chill day and did some chores.

Today I was hiking at the Wildalpjoch and Käserwand in Bayrischzell, Bavaria.

I went there with my brother and, as always with me and him as a combo, we absolutely smashed the tour... as in: we are the biggest clowns to hike there ever. First, we go up and then literally climb a wall up to get to the wrong summit, only to then get my fear-of-heights-ass down there again. Then, we somehow go the wrong the way down and end up somewhere on a field. Instead of going up to get to the path again, we go through a muddy field to get to a barbed wire fence. Then we crawl under the fence like some fucking criminals and get on the way back to our car. Oh yeah and we also went the wrong way again, so we hiked up a little hill to end up on the right path that was so fucking muddy that my shoes and my lower leg was covered in mud.

I fucking loved it 💕

## Recap of Week 20

- ❌ **Thesis** start working on the thesis

## Focus of Week 21

- **Thesis** start working on the thesis

Ah yes, good old procrastination strikes again. Well, I realized I'm not gonna start working on this thing, unless I have some kind of deadline. So I talked to my supervisor at university and we set up regular meetings, instead of waiting until I have something to discuss with him. Now I have a meeting with him on Friday and I need to have something to show until then &mdash; I call this a *soft deadline*. 

I feel like these kind of soft deadlines can help tremendously with procrastination. Doing all the work just before the deadline usually ends in a half-assed result. Instead of doing this, I'm now gonna be motivated to bring up half-assed results every week. In the end, all these little results will add up and form a perfect, full-assed super result that will blow everyone away. Well, at least that's what I hope happens 😬 

If you show up and do little by little everyday, it'll add up and you will get somewhere. I guess that is true for life in general 😊

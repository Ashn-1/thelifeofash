Todays description was 'wingless iron dragon'. Also I bought some coloring pencils and now my drawing looks like it was made by a child &mdash; a grown up child. The drawing is called *Ferrit Dragon* (#306):

Anyway, tomorrow I'm gonna go camping in the *Schwarzwald* near Stuttgart. I'm really looking forward to go on hikes and have some peace and quiet there üòÅ

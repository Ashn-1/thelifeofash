I had the first meeting today concerning my master thesis. We discussed the overall topic and the first big step within my thesis. Although the official start of the thesis will not be until probably September, it's nice to already know what I will have to do when my thesis officially starts.

Also, I got the okay to do my thesis externally, which means I will already get a contract with the company I currently work at as a working student. I got the general okay for this from my manager at work, however, I still need to discuss the exact contract and everything with them. Damn, I gotta negotiate a work contract... Time for some YouTube tutorials on how to do this ðŸ¤”

Anyway, here is a picture of a small sunflower:

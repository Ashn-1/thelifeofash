Nothing major happened today: I just studied for university and also got a new plant. I kinda forgot to take a picture and it's a little too dark for a good photoshoot, so I'll add some pictures of it tomorrow.

Also, I want to track the growth of some of my plants with some pictures. I guess this daily journal is a good place for that, so I'll take one day of the week and do a *Plant Update Day* out of it. I'm not sure which day to pick, but I'll figure something out üòÅ

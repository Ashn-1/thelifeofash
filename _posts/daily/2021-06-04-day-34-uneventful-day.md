Today was pretty much an uneventful life. Uneventful as in nothing major happened in my head. I woke up and chilled for two or three hours, worked on my term paper and went skating.

The only 'eventful' thing today was that I finally started to play Terraria with a friend of mine. We planned to do some time ago, but as always life got in the way and we had to delay it. Today we finally sat together and played a little. I had a lot of fun, even though we died like 20 times the first night in the game. Although, that probably made it even more fun 😁

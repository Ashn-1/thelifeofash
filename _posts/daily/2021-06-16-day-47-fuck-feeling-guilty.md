I decided to day that I'm not going to do university stuff after a full day of work. 

Today after work, I ate something and then starred at my PC screen for some time. I wanted to go outside and cycle or skate around, but I felt guilty for not doing anything for university today, which is absurd 'cause I just worked for 8 hours and I'm mentally exhausted from work. There is no way I get anything productive out of my brain onto the screen for university. 

As a compromise I wrote one paragraph and then said 'Fuck this shit' and went outside to cycle. I rode 27 km and now I'm feeling both physically and mentally exhausted and it feels like a good day to me. I'll probably instantly fall asleep the second I touch my bed.

So, I will try not to feel guilty for not working on university stuff after working for the entire day and doing whatever the fuck I want after coming home from work. 

Fuck feeling guilty for stupid shit!

I had to finish part of my term paper today and send it to my supervisor, so he could review it. I knew I had to finish it and I knew it would only take me 2 to 3 hours, yet I pushed it off the entire day and did other things. I cleaned my room and the kitchen, watered my plants, played some video games, thought about going skating, cooked some food, played some more video games, etc. None of these things are bad to do, in fact, most of these are chores that I had to do today anyways. Yet, because I didn't do my work first I had this lingering feeling of guilt hanging over my head the entire day. No matter what I did today, I felt guilty not working on my term paper and I full well knew that this would happen. Yet my mind just didn't want to bother starting to work and rather feel bad for the entire day. I don't understand the human mind...

Oh yeah, I finally started to work on my term paper at 7pm and finished it at 8:30pm. I felt guilt for an entire day for only 1:30 hours of work that I could've easily done in the morning and enjoyed the rest of my day. I should definitely work on this...

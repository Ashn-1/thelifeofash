Today I saw a little girl on a seesaw. She jumped so energetically up, you'd think she tried to push the earth away. She was smiling as she proudly turned her head towards her mother and shouted 'Look at how high I can jump! Look here!'.

Her mother, distracted by her phone, glanced over, looked at her briefly before turning back to her phone: 'You're doing great honey.'

The little girl continued jumping on the seesaw. On the other side there was an empty seat. 

She was all alone.

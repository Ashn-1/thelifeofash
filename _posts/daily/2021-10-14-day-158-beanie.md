A few days ago, I finished knitting my first ever beanie 😬

To be honest, I have never had and actually used a beanie in my life before &mdash; I kinda never was beanie guy. But now I own one that I knitted myself, so there goes another reason for actually using it and not freezing to death this coming winter 🥶

Also, after seeing my beanie, my brother wanted one too and it is already finished. I guess there goes my first ever commission 😎 Now I just need to do this en masse and I will be an successful entrepreneur 🥴

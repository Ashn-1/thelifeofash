## Recap of Week 8

- ✅ **University** finish first draft of my term paper
- ❌ **University** start watching lectures for first exam
- ❌ **Blog** finish next blog post

## Plan for Week 9

- **University** start watching lectures for first exam
- **Blog** finish next blog post

I managed to finish the draft of my term paper and also incorporated some of the rough changes that my supervisor and I discussed. Now he'll read it in more detail and I'll hopefully be done with writing at the end of next week. Other than that my focus was kinda lost. I neither started to learn for the exam I have in one and a half weeks, nor did I continue to write my blog post. 

As for the blog post, I have high hopes I'll finish it next week, as I don't have to write my term paper anymore and have more writing energy for my blog posts. I'll set my next deadline to Sunday next week for the blog post, it's high time this one comes out...

With the extra time I now have in combination with the imminence of the exam, I'll most definitely start learning for my exam from now on out. Otherwise I'm gonna be pretty fucked 🥴

I was also skating 🛹 today and got my first intimate moment with the pavement 💋. What a lovely gal; a bit rough on the outside and also rough on the inside, but lovely nonetheless. 

Anyway, here is my little sunflower Lena. She is so close to blooming 😊

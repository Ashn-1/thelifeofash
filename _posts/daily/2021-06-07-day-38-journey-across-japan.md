There is this guy on YouTube called [Chris Broad](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHL9bfHTxCMi-7vfxQ-AYtg), who lives in Japan and makes videos about various places in Japan that one could visit. From food over nature to culture, he makes videos about everything that is fascinating about Japan. His most recent adventure goes through some of the southern islands of Japan, and after watching his latest video about [Kagushima and Yakushima](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-rIWP1icf4) made me really wanna go visiting Japan again. Goddamn, the nature there is stunning ðŸ˜®

This video is another installement of his multi-seasoned series called 'Journey Across Japan'. The original 'Journey Across Japan' took him on a 2000 km long bicycle ride through Japan, which was both super interesting to watch and also an insane accomplishment for him as a person. The second 'Journey Across Japan' took him on a multi-day tour to Mt. Fuji, the biggest mountain in Japan. And finally now, he is visiting the southern tip of Japan with all its untouched, subtropical nature.

Damn, now I really wanna go there and experience it for myself... Soonâ„¢

I went on vacation today! After a mere 4 hour long car trip to the other side of Germany, we finally reached the *Schwarzwald* and our campsite. I never knew that this area of Germany was so hilly. Let's just say my car had a hard time getting anywhere with any amount of speed ðŸ¥´

Anyway, we got here and then the rain began... and it did not stop. At least the sound of the rain splashing on top of the tent is really soothing.

My drawing for today is called *Fake 2Header* (#079):

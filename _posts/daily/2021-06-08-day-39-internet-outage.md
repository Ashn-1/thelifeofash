After working the entire day, I just wanted to enjoy some leisure time and wind down my day with some good old YouTube. Too bad that my internet provider had other plans for today. Since yesterday there are random internet outages that last for a few minutes until they go away. Nothing more heartbreaking than watching a YouTube video and getting the loading circle of death starting an involuntary break from the internet.

It's kinda sad that I'm so reliant on one medium to keep me entertained and that just now that the internet went down again, I was just sitting there without a single clue what I could do now without it. Dunno why, but I feel like this much dependency on one thing is kinda unhealthy.

For some time now, I thought about setting up distraction free times in my day. Maybe a few times a week in the evening, I'll go completely offline for the rest of the day. Just going outside, crafting something, making art or music, whatever really. I can't remember the last time, when I wasn't looking at a screen for extended periods of time before going to sleep, and I don't really think that's healthy either. 

So maybe I'll just shut everything off and do something and then go to sleep on some days of the week. On paper that sounds like a good idea. Let's see how this goes.

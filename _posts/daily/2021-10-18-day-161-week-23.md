## Recap of Week 23

- ‚ùå **Yoga** do some yoga again; find the best time in a day to do yoga
- ‚úÖ **Website** design the frontpage of my blog

## Focus of Week 24

- **Yoga** do yoga 3 times
- **Website** publish the new website

Well, I didn't quite figure out the perfect time to do yoga, in fact, I didn't even touch my yoga mat ü•¥ So I'm going to rephrase the focus to something more tangible, here, to 3 times yoga for week 24.

As for my website redesign: I did not only finish the design process of my new website frontpage, I'm pretty much finished with implementing the website! üòÅ There are still some minor tweaks and some descriptions missing that I want to finish before I publish the website. However, for now I've set next Sunday as the deadline by which the new website should be up and running.

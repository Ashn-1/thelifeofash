I mean, I'm the sweaty one, but the helmet definitely doesn't help there. There are a few fabric strips inside the helmet that act as a cushion between your head and the helmet. Those fabric strips are completely wet after a few minutes of being active. I love it ðŸ¥´

Anyway, I tried to learn how to do a *Shuv It*, but didn't manage to get one today. Still, I made some progress: I kinda know now what to do to make the board stay under me and not jump away. Btw, this is how a *Shuv It* should look like:

{% include youtube-player.html id="2GtRniMPaVk" %}

Even these easy tricks are somewhat tricky at the beginning, and I kinda like it. It makes it challenging, but in a way that I want to figure it out.

I like skateboarding ðŸ›¹ðŸ’•

It's funny how much mental gymnastics your brain does when it comes to mental issues. It distorts reality to an incredible degree just to save you from threats that are, more often than not, non-existing. However, this distortion drains so much energy that you can't bring yourself to do something with your life. In the end, your anxieties eat up all the energy you have and at the end of the day you sit there wondering why you are so tired despite not doing anything... 

Well, you weren't doing anything, but your mind was; your anxiety is like a parasite feeding off of you.

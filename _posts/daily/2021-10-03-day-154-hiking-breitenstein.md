So, I went hiking at Breitenstein in Fischbachau. This mountain is also part of the mountain chain that I hiked at [previously]({% post_url daily/2021-09-19-days-141-142-week-20-and-hiking-tour %}).

There are still some summits here to conquer before I'm officially done here. I feel like at this point I can't back off anymore and I have to finish all of the mountains here ðŸ˜¬

Also, I really need to buy some hiking boots and hiking poles before going on another hike. They are gonna make my life so much easier ðŸ¥´

Today, I went on a cycling tour with a friend. 

We took the train to get to *Wasserburg am Inn* and cycled from there back home. I have never cycled a route that had this many hills to climb &mdash; my legs can attest to this, they feel crushed. At least the scenery was beautiful: there were fields everywhere; I just love that about Germany's country side.

Also, near the end of the tour I drove over a big rock and managed to puncture the inner tube of my tire. We tried to fix the little tear with a small repair kit, only to realize there was a second tear directly below the first one. We just gave up and my friend drove to the nearby bike store to buy a new inner tube. We put it inside the tire and pumped it like half full and we drove off. Case closed.

Some stats for the tour:

<table class="table-vertical">
    <tr><th>Time</th>       <td>3:40 hours</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Distance</th>   <td>68.1 km</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Avg. Speed</th> <td>18.5 km/h</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Max. Speed</th> <td>~60 km/h</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Uphill</th>     <td>580 m</td></tr>
</table>

Anyway, I really enjoyed the tour ðŸ˜Š

The last two weeks I've been working with a different team of our group at work and I am really enjoying it there. Despite working 8 hours a day, it doesn't really feel like it. I guess this is due to the varying tasks I have to do here. I rarely sit on the same task for long and I can spread my mental capacity on different areas of work. I think this is a way of work that my brain can handle quite well.

I'm gonna be here for an additional three weeks and afterwards I'll be back with my old team. However, I have the possibility to stay and continue to work here, if I so desire. I'll see how it goes for the rest of the time here and then I'll decide on where to continue working.

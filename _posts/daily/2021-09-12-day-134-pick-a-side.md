I went to the [IAA Mobility](https://www.iaa.de/en/mobility), a trade fair focusing on how the mobility of the future looks like. All the most well-known car manufacturers of the world were present here and presenting the newest and most shiniest thing they have to offer. In addition to cars, there were also car suppliers, bicycle manufacturers and a lot of utility companies present.

And in parallel to the trade fair itself, there were a lot of demonstrations against the IAA. In particular, the protests were about a more environmental friendly mobility in the future, instead of the current approach to look environmental friendly and future oriented, while ignoring the core problems at hand.

At the end of the day, I was wondering on which side I wanted to stand on. I was torn between some of the fascinating consumer oriented things presented at the IAA and the gut feeling that I should stand against all this and fight for a better future. 

I wonder if I would have felt the same the other way around, if I went to the protests and not the IAA. Or maybe I would have felt like I was in the right place. I really don't know which side to pick in this debate.

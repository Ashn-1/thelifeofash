Today I worked a little on my university stuff. For a project of my mine, I had to minimize the curvature of a trajectory given only a few ways to adjust it. I came up with a solution based on intuition last week, but my supervisor told me I had to somehow come up with a mathematical proof that the intuition is correct. I guess that is how science works. 

Anyway, after about two hours of calculating around I finally came up with a half-assed mathematical jumble that kinda proofed my point. Tomorrow I'm going to work a little more on that and see if my supervisor is satisfied with it, or if I have to actually do some math.

Also, I realized that this entire university thing is just not my cup of tea. Somehow it is more important that everything is neatly presented and correct mathematically, rather than actually solve a problem. This is not to say that I disregard the way science works. I'm just saying that I personally don't want have anything to do with this ever again after I'm done with my degree. I'll probably not ever set foot into a university again. Ever. Oh well, only a year to go with this nonsense...

I feel like the work-life balance during the exam phase goes out the window for almost all students. I worked today for 8 hours, got home and ate something and then sat there and studied for my exam next week, while being tired as fuck. I guess I will end my university life the same way I entered it: with procrastination, regret, and the good ol' classic 'cram as much information into my head the week before the exam'. Woohoo...

I guess the only saving grace here is that I will be done with university next year.

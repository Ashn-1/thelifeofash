Today, when I woke up, I was not feeling very well &mdash; kinda down you know. So I made myself a coffee, took some soup I prepped some days before and put it into a pot with some noodles to heat it up, went back to my computer and sat down. 

I already finished my website design the day before. I thought I should just upload the new version and not put it off indefinitely without any particular reason. So I removed all the files from my old website, uploaded the new one and with some bugfixing finally made it work and was satisfied with my work. Well, as you can probably see, if you've read any of my previous daily entries here, the website has changed.

While the development of the website will be an ongoing thing and not actually be finished at any point in time, I'm really proud of how it turned out üòÅ It's minimalistic and modern, and the focus of the entire website is on the posts without any kind of distractions.

By the way, do you remember that soup I put on the stove? Yep, me neither.

When I finally did remember it, I got up and ran to the kitchen, only to be confronted with the smell of burnt food. Yes, you heard that right, I managed to burn my soup ü•¥

Oh and when I took off the lid to see how bad it was, the fire alarm of my flat went off. Turns out, we have a fire alarm in our hall and not only in the individual rooms, as I previously assumed. So I actually had to look in a few rooms before I finally found the one that went off.

I opened the window in the kitchen put the burnt soup in front of the window and then disabled the fire alarm after nearly going deaf.

What a way to start the day üòÖ

Also, I realized that you tend to forget all your sorrows, when confronted with something as stupid as burning a soup. So if you ever feel sad or depressed, just sacrifice a soup by burning it and your mood will be lifted üî•

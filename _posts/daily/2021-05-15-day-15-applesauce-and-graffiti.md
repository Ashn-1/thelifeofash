I made some applejuice today! 😋

I had some apples leftover that were a little too ripe and... intersting looking, so I decided to cook them into some applesauce. The recipe was surprisingly easy: cut the apples into small pieces and them and a little water, vanilla and cinnamon into a pot and cook it on low heat for 15 minutes or so. Afterwards just purée the apples until they have a jam-like consistency and you're done. It also tastes surprisingly good for how easy it was to make. Now I just need a dish were I can use the applesauce 🤔

Also, while wandering around town with a friend today, we discovered a graffiti under a bridge with some spectres and soldiers. The graffiti itself looked pretty cool, but more importantly: that one spectre has one helluva 🍑

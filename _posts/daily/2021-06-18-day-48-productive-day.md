My main focus of today was to finish some parts of my term paper. And unlike other days, where I couldn't be bothered to even open my editor, I actually did it. I finished three chapters and I'm gonna finish another one tomorrow before the meeting with my supervisor. 

My goal was to finish a complete draft of the term paper by today, but I didn't manage to do that. In hindsight, this goal was set too high and now I'm adjusting it. I'll try to finish the draft until Sunday and send it to my supervisor for correction. Currently, my supervisor and myself set the deadline to Friday next week, so we can work on the presentation that I have to hold in front of his entire academic chair.

Anyway, I worked on my term paper today and then I was done for the day and felt great. Somehow I felt free, instead of the usual guilt that creeps up, and I went out and enjoyed the rest of my evening with some nice skating and reading in the park. It was nice üòä

I also realized today that a great day for me can look vastly different depending on my internal and external world. Currently, my life consists of work, writing and (hopefully soon) studying paired with activities like cycling, skating and meeting friends. For August I have planned to go on vacation, camping and go cycling a lot. Also, when I feel down a good day might just look like doing nothing and relaxing. I don't have to experience new stuff everyday of my life and I especially don't have to compete with other people in who's life looks the best. We all have different goals, different definitions of a great day and we all like to do different things, so why even bother to compare üòÅ

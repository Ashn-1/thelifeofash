After gracefully failing my cold shower challenge and taking a break from challenges for June, I'm back now with another challenge I actually want to do: Yoga as a morning routine.

The one thing I struggle with in my life every single day is getting out of bed. I can't remember a day when I actually wanted to get out of bed and start the day. Obviously, when I got work or other places I have to be in the morning, I will get out of bed early. But otherwise I lay there for up to an hour and just postpone getting out of bed. As a result, some of my productive morning hours are wasted on not doing anything. Kinda annoying ðŸ™„

I also wanted to start doing yoga for some time now. It's basically meditation, but with physical activity. Sounds like it should be something that I like doing. After watching Akta's [Yoga for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWw9MuQ7Wa0) video on YouTube, I got intereseted in trying it out for myself. She recommended another YouTube channel called [Fightmaster Yoga](https://www.youtube.com/user/lesleyfightmaster) for some guided yoga sessions. I've been doing her [Yoga for Beginners 30 Day Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEs9dX8UXFZqbJf-Cbm3zYDVkS53PlThW) videos for a few days now and I've been really enjoying it. The poses she teaches in these beginner videos are actually doable for beginners and, while I can't fully stretch myself like her in the video, I get somewhat close to it for some of the poses. Highly recommend her channel for learning lots of stuff about yoga.

So, as for my challenge for July, I decided to wake up early (at least early for me) at 7am and do some yoga. On days when I work, I probably need to get up a little earlier. My main focus is gonna be to get out of bed the moment I wake up, instead of laying there for an extended period of time and do some yoga to get some exercise and wake up properly.

I'm really excited to try out yoga more extensivelly this month ðŸ˜Š

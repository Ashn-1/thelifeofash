Well, somehow I just didn't want to write a post while camping. So, here you go with two posts at once ðŸ˜¬

Yesterday, we walked around the *Titisee* and ate some coffee and cake at a little shop at another campsite. The coffee was meh, but the scenery was beautiful:

Afterwards, we went back to the town square with all the little shops and did some souvenir hunting. There were a few wooden utensils that I was interested in, but in the end I didn't get anything as it didn't seem like an actual souvenir from here. 

Also, next to the main shopping area, there was a little park with beautiful flowers:

Then, in the evening, we chilled at the campsite until it was too cold to be outside anymore &mdash; and then we chilled there some more and froze to death. Great 10/10 experience ðŸ’¯

Today, we finally left the campsite. After a little breakfast at the local cafÃ© with some waffles and vanilla ice cream, we drove to our second destination of this vacation: Stuttgart. 

Back a year or so ago, we randomly just made a joke and screamed 'STUTTGART, WHERE ARE YOU?' as if we were giving a concert in Stuttgart. Yeah I know, funny as fuck, right? ðŸ¥´ And so we decided to transform this joke into reality and made plans to go visit Stuttgart and now we are here.

Anyway, today we just chilled at our AirBnB and cruised around with our boards. Tomorrow we'll be doing proper sightseeing in Stuttgart itself.

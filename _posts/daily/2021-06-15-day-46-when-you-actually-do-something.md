At some point today I sat down and actually worked for 2 hours straight on my term paper and made some progress. I swear, if I started to do this earlier I'd be done with university like 3 years ago. Anyway, I wrote part of a chapter today, which I'm going to finish tomorrow and then continue to write on Thursday. My first 'deadline' is on Thursday when I should be finished at least with the evaluation and discussion part. Afterwards, I'm going to add the theoretical parts, which I already dread writing. I still have to start watching lecture, but I'll probably get to that on Thursday. Man, the next few weeks are gonna be a nightmare... But that's on me, I could have started earlier, like I'm saying I'm gonna do every semester. Oh well...

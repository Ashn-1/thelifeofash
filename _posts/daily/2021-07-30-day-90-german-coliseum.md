I visited a friend today in Nuremberg and we went to a fair and rode some of the attractions there. Turns out that fair is located next to the Coliseum... nope, I did not suddenly teleported to Rome and went to the Coliseum there. Apparently there is a Coliseum in Nuremberg that was built by Hitler for whatever reason.

Currently, this gigantic building is used for an exhibition of the documentation center and also partially used by the symphony orchestra of Nuremberg. I'm not sure if this building could ever be used properly because of the historical baggage that it carries. Then again, if this gigantic building is not used in any way, maybe the best thing is to demolish it and rebuild something more useful. Dunno...

Obviously this would be a great place for an image of the Coliseum, but I may or may not have forgotten to take one... Whoops ðŸ˜¬

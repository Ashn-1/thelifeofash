Today I was skating around with a friend. I think we arrived home just shy of the 4 hour mark of being outside. Obviously we weren't skating the entire time, but still way longer than both of us would have anticipated. 

I was having a blast skating around! And just after 2 hours of cruising around, I realized I was doing it wrong and I changed my foot position from the front of my board a little bit back. Et voil√†, it got so much easier to accelerate and handle the board. I should definitely listen to the advice given to me and not ignore it... Whoops üò¨

I got a lot more confident standing on the board and accelerating today, which I'm very proud of after just two days of practicing. I also practiced to ride over cracks and small elevations in the ground. Apparently all you have to do is drive over them with an angle of like 45 degress and everything is fine. At least when the crack is not super wide.

Anyway, I want to keep on cruising the next days, given that the weather is not shit, and keep on getting better. In addition to practicing the basics like accelerating, balancing and turning, I want to practice kickturns to better cruise around without getting off the board so much. Personally, I want to first learn everything to make my life cruising around easier and not learn any tricks that just look cool. There is still time to learn those things afterwards üòú

Sidenote: I really enjoy writing about things other then my thoughts for a change. I think after doing this for some time it kinda gets a little... depressing? I guess. Well anyway, I like the change üòÅ

Sidenote<sup>2</sup>: I'm gonna add the time I spent writing these entries to each post from now on. You can find it at the top under the title. [Roadtoramen](https://roadtoramen.com/), which this daily journal was inspired by, has this too and I really liked the idea of tracking the time and now I'm adding it. Maybe I'll do some stats at the end of each month or so, let's see...

## Recap of Week 24

- ❌ **Yoga** do yoga 3 times
- ✅ **Website** publish the new website

## Focus of Week 25

- **Yoga** do yoga 2 times

I published the new design of my website! Yay! 😁 

As a result all my daily entries can now be found here on my main blog site, rather than on a subdomain. I feel like this is more fitting for the content that I'm going for. I like all my posts to be in one place together with my art and stories. Just like they all reside in one place in real life &mdash; inside my head 🧠

There are still many things I want to implement and also change regarding the website. This includes adding a dark mode, a search bar, and changing the menus on the mobile version of the website. However, I want to first put some focus on writing larger posts. I haven't written anything longer in a while and I have some thoughts that I want to formulate out and put out there into the world 😬 

As for the yoga part of my focus, it didn't go so well. I mean, I did yoga once... today... for 15 minutes before I was feeling like I was dying. I guess that's what I get for doing a core workout yoga session without any existing core strength 🤷🏽‍♀️

And because it went so well with yoga I'm just gonna drag this into the next week and do it again. This time twice in a week. I feel like this is a more achievable goal for me regarding my yoga sessions.

There won't be any other focus for next week, as I will be having a busy pretty much the entire week.

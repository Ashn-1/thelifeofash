## Recap of Week 2

- ‚ùå **University:** focus on watching lectures and working on university assignments
  - Barely did anything for university

## Plan for Week 3

- **University:** focus on watching lectures and working on university assignments; this time for real tho
- **Blog:** finish blog post on my April challenge and publish it

I did very little for university this week and I also decided to drop one of my classes today. I already have a term paper and two other courses I have to work on, so I decided that I don't need the extra pressure on that third course. Especially because that third course needs a lot of time (8 credits worth), where I only need one more credit.

I'm also hardcore procrastinating on my blog post for my April challenge. I wanted to publish it at the beginning of the month, but I didn't. And then it went on and on without getting finished. I'll probably commit to a fix deadline from now on for my posts. I thought about publishing one post every first Sunday of the month. That should hopefully motivate me to actually work on my projects and put some effort in there...

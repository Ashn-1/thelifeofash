Sometimes I wind down for the day, look at the clock and realize I could go to sleep now, just to realize that I forgot to write an entry here. Then I have to pull out some shit, write a post about it and wrap it up, because I'm too tired to actually write about some of my more interesting thoughts. I should probably write these entries earlier in the day. Oh well, maybe next time...

Anyway, today I finally started to write my term paper... and with that I mean, I prepared everything to start writing tomorrow. I got the template from the faculty website, setup the LaTeX environment and then threw everything out the window, because fuck Ubuntu and Linux. I switched to my PC with Windows and everything just worked. Sometimes I wonder why I torture myself by using Ubuntu on my laptop.

Anyway<sup>2</sup>,  I wrote the outline of the paper and then it was already 8pm. At least I've also watched one more lecture today, so I did actually do something today for university. I should really get going with my paper, as it is already due in three weeks and I have to still write the entire thing and test some more things with the software. I feel like the next few weeks are gonna be very fun... 

At least I'm gonna be done with university soon.

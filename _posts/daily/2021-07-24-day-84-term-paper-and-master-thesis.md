Today was the last meeting with my supervisor for my term paper. Next week I will present the results to the other collegues at the chair and then I will be officially finished with this part of my degree.

Also, I will continue the topic of my term paper into my master thesis. I discussed this with my supervisor and we will sit together and work out what will be part of my thesis next week. Because I want to do the thesis externally, i.e. in the industry as opposed to at the university, I will then need to forumlate the thesis topic together with my supervisor at work and hand that to the secretary of the chair at university. Kinda unnecessarily complicated, but I'll take it, as long as I can do it externally.

Damn, I will be finished with university next year ðŸ¤”...

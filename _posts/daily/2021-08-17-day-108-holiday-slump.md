I'm the most motivated to do things I love to do during my exam phase. It's as if my brain tries to shift its focus onto the things I like, when I would have to do things I dislike. Yet, immediately after the exams are finished, this motivation drifts away and I become unmotivated again. Then I slowly lose my traction and day by day stop doing my hobbies. This cycle then repeats again six months later with the next exams.

When I have the time, I don't use it properly, and when I do have the time, I just throw it out the window. Also, these six month breaks always lead to a reset in all the progress I made. I start back again where I was six months ago or at the best slightly ahead. This cycle lead to me not really progressing in anything, I would have liked to progress in. 

I always called it a *lack of discipline*, though I'm not sure if it has anything to do with discipline &mdash; I wouldn't know how else to call it though.

But what else is there to do, other then to try again? [I said I wanted to figure out a sideproject]({% post_url daily/2021-08-01-day-92-focus %}) that I wanted to finish before the next semester starts, but I haven't yet decided on what to do. It basically boils down to either doing a musical thing, like recording some bass covers, or doing something with programming, like an app or a game. Maybe I'll decide to do both of them, in order to have some variety in the things I want to focus on. I will decide on this by the end of the week.

This year I am doing one challenge every month. My challenge for May is to eat vegan. Five days into the challenge I stumbled upon my first little hurdle. 

It was my first day of going to work as a vegan and I kinda assumed that the cafeteria offers at least one vegan dish every day. Well, I was wrong, there were two dishes with meat and one vegetarian dish with eggs in it. So I took one of the big salad bowls and a tiny glass bottle with olive oil and vinegar so that my salad doesn't look sad as fuck.

I might sound a little pretentious only five days into my month of being vegan - why do they have to adjust to my voluntary diet? You are absolutely right. I am doing this voluntarily; not because of moral reasons. I would absolutely not mind taking the burger or stuffing myself with eggs. I don't need other options other then the currently given ones. But there are people who absolutely cannot eat these things, either because of physical reasons (allergies and intolerances) or moral reasons. If you are only offering three dishes, why not accommodate more dietary restrictions? Maybe offer one meat dish, one vegan/vegetarian and another gluten/lactose free dish. Or whatever the most common dietary restrictions are. Don't exclude people just because you are lazy...

One of my best friends got engaged yesterday. It was a beautiful surprise planned by her partner with all her friends in the room. I'm really happy for her ðŸ˜Š

However, it also put into perspective where I am in my own life right now and where I would have liked to be; I'm nowhere near that. I feel like I waste my energy in the wrong places, like I put it into things that make my life nice, instead of concentrating on the things that would make my life awesome. I feel like I always take the safe bet circling around the same place, when instead I should be taking a leap of faith off this tower of solitude. I don't really know what to do...

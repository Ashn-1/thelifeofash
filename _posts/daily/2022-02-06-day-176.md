I'll make this one short. I need to focus a lot of my time now on learning for my last exam and writing my thesis. Apart from that I want to put a little of my time into practicing bass.

## Focus of Week 26

- **Exam** finish watching all lectures and exercises
- **Thesis** finish the Related Works and Theory section of the thesis
- **Bass** learn _Fallen Leaves_ by Billy Talent

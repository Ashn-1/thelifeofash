## Recap of Week 5

- âœ… **University** focus on writing my term paper

## Plan for Week 6

- **University** finish first draft of my term paper

Last weeks focus was on writing my term paper. I layed down the structure of the paper and also started to record some of the results. I've also sent one part containing most of the mathematics of the paper to my supervisor for a preliminary review. Let's see if my math checks ðŸ¥´

For next week I want to finish the first draft of the paper. I don't have much else to work on for university, so I should be able to focus my non-work days completely on writing my paper. Technically the deadline is June 14th, but my supervisor already told me that the deadline is flexible and doesn't really have much of any meaning. I don't think a deadline by definition can be flexble, but hey, I'll take any extra time I can get ðŸ˜¬

Between laziness, forgetfulness and unexpecteded events, I kinda didn't upload an entry the last two days. Whoops ðŸ˜… 

Anyway, there wasn't anything particular to write about anyway. At work I got the okay to change to the other team I worked in for a month some time ago. I'm going back to the bois ðŸ˜Ž Also, the 10 minute walking time to work were very tempting ðŸ˜¬

There's also another hike planned for Saturday. I'm already looking forward to it and I hope it doesn't rain then. That would be kinda wack ðŸ¥´

I also bought a circular knitting needle for knitting a beanie and already have some wool to start the project. This time I'm using very thick wool, so this project should not take that long &mdash; in before I start the beanie and then pause knitting for 9 months again ðŸ˜¬ I'm gonna keep you updated with my progress.

Anyway, that's about it ðŸ¤”

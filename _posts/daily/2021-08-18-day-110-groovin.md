Song tip: *Worse Than This* by *Zebrahead*

Sometimes I have these weird phases in my life where I feel like shit and don't really know why. I feel down and don't really want to do anything at all &mdash; even things I usually like to do, don't feel right to me and I can't quite seem to enjoy them. Also, I feel drained very fast, so I can't do anything for longer periods of time without completely drifting away mentally.

I used to think that I have to work hard to get out of these ruts and get back to to my life. Somehow I totally missed the part where feeling bad is part of my life. Instead of trying to change something that cannot be changed in the moment, I should learn to live with it and just take everything a little slower. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm still bad at doing this, but at least I acknowledge that this is how it sometimes goes in my life. And you know how they say: Acceptance is the first step towards world domination... or something like that ðŸ¤”

Anyway, I'm not sure why, but after feeling bad for a while I feel like I have spare energy to throw out the window, so I feel extra fresh. In fact, I feel so extra fresh and full of energy that I want to fuck shit up and do something ðŸ˜¬

There was so much I wanted to do today.

I wanted to tackle a new task I got at work today, yet I just couldn't concentrate and work properly. 

I wanted to watch another lecture today, yet I could not get myself to sit there for an hour and listen to a topic I am not interested in. 

I wanted to start writing my term paper, yet starting to write seemed so impossible to do.

I wanted to start brainstorming my next blog post that is due next week, yet I pushed that off because I didn't feel like writing.

I wanted to finish learning a song today, yet I barely made any progress on it compared to yesterday.

I wanted to skate today, and I actually went twice. 

My legs are crushed and my soul is asking itself whether it follows the right things in life or if it's just on a path that will inevitably reach a dead end at some point. 

Truth be told, I don't know and I wonder if I'll ever know. 

My soul is crushed and my legs are asking themselves if they are gonna hurt the entire summer like the last few years and when this will end.

Truth be told, they probably will as I like to be outside and do something actively; or maybe I'm just trying to escape something by being away for as long as possible.

I don't know. I guess this is part of life...

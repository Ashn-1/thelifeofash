It has been one week since I started this daily journal and I have to say: I kinda like it. I really enjoy the process of reflecting about what I do and think each day and then picking one of these things and writing a journal entry about them. This level of self-reflection is something that I think will slowly improve my life over time.

Also, I think leaving the overall topic of this journal blank and just writing about whatever I feel like writing about, actually helped me to keep at it without it ever feeling like a chore I have to do. Of course I'm only one week into at least several more months of journaling, but still it already feels easier to do than my other attempts at journaling.

There are also a lot more things I want to try with these journal entries. I like the idea of having weekly or monthly reviews were I can look at what I achieved in that time and then set my focus for the upcoming week or month. These will probably not be some specific tasks, but rather a more general focus on specific hobbies or personal habits like sleeping or eating. 

I also thought about doing weekly music reviews, where I listen to an entire album and then give a brief opinion. Or maybe I name my most listened song for that week and discuss a little about why I like that song or what emotions it evokes in myself.

I'm really excited to see how this daily journal will evolve over the next couple weeks and months! üòÅ

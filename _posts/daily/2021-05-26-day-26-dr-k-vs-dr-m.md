I just watched [Dr K's](https://www.twitch.tv/healthygamer_gg) stream on Twitch, where he talked with [Dr Mike](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0QHWhjbe5fGJEPz3sVb6nw) about Mike's life, career and all the problems that come with that. It was really interesting to see two doctors discuss topics on such a high level. I really enjoyed the stream!

One thing that came up very often near the end of the stream, was that Dr Mike was constantly trivialising his failures and hardships in life. Obviously, Dr K noticed that and picked on that particular subject for some time. The stream also covered topics of happiness and the age old question of what happiness is, how the state of happiness can be achieved and whether it actually is something that one should strive to get.

The entire stream was really interesting and entertaining to watch and I highly recommend everyone to watch the VOD on [Dr K's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClHVl2N3jPEbkNJVx-ItQIQ) whenever it's uploaded.

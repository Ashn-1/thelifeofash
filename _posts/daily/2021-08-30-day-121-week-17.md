## Recap of Week 17

- ‚ùå **Morning Routine** do yoga before work in the morning

## Focus for Week 18

- **Morning Routine** wake up at 7am on workdays

I'm gonna be honest, doing 30 minutes of yoga every morning ain't gonna happen. I'm not a morning person and I think the prospect of doing sport is putting more friction between me and a decent morning. So I will be taking a step back and try to get out of bed earlier and maybe drink a tea and read a book or something. I feel like this is going to be more of an incentive for me to wake up earlier than doing yoga.

Maybe I'll return to yoga in the morning later on, when I established getting up earlier. For now, I just have to wake up early ü•¥

## Recap of Week 6

- ‚ùå **University** finish first draft of my term paper

## Plan for Week 7

- **University** finish first draft of my term paper
- **University** start watching lectures again
- **Blog** finish next blog post

I didn't manage to finish a draft of my term paper, well, I didn't even come close, but this week I definitely will. 'Definitely' as in I have a deadline for submitting my first draft for next week Thursday. These are gonna be some interesting days.

I also need to start watching the VODs of one of my lectures. The exam is at the beginning of next month and I didn't even look at what this lecture is about. At least there are only 3 or 4 videos to watch...

Finally, I set my deadline for writing blog posts to the first Sunday of each month. That was last week Sunday and I'm still not finished with writing my post. I only have the outline with a few keywords for some of the topics I want to cover. I'm not very far to be honest. Anyway, I want to release the post next week, because I want to. That's it, I want to work on the things that are important to me and not only the work that is given to me by others.

Let's see how far I'll get.

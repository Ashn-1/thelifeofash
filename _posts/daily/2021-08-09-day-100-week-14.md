## Recap of Week 14

- ‚úÖ **Relax** take some time off and do whatever I want to do

## Focus for Week 15

- **Blog** finish blog post about doing yoga for a month

Well well, vacation time is truly a blessing &mdash; at least as far as relaxing goes. I didn't even think about starting to write my next blog post. I even had problems writing these daily entries some days. But you know what, I had vacation, so fuck all responsibilities.

However, I will finish my next blog post until next week. Also, I will most likely not write about these 30 day challenges anymore. I'm somewhat tired to write about them and want to explore other subjects.

Also, this is the 100th day doing this daily journal &mdash; damn, time just flew by, I love it üòÅ  
Some statistics for the 100th day:

| Total Posts | 98 |
| Favorite Posts | 13 |
| Time Writing | 21h 11min |

To another great 100 days! üòä

I thought a little bit about the purpose of this daily journal. According to the front page of this journal, it contains 

> '... entries about thoughts and feelings that occupied my mind, raw ideas my brain came up with, activities I did in my life and progress I made in one of my projects.'

This description is true, this blog *is* an amalgamation of my daily thoughts, yet this description lacks a motif. What is it that I'm searching for by writing these posts? What message lies between each line? Do I really just want to braindump my day on the internet? I don't think that's what it is. I feel like I *am* searching for something, but the question remains what this thing is and if I can actually find it by writing everyday.

The description of [Road to Ramen](https://roadtoramen.com), which is the daily journal that inspired me to start this journal in the first place, reads:

> This is my public journal where I think aloud and share everything I learn in exploring the question: Can I make a living building things I love?

It perfectly explains what can be found within each post *and* the overarching theme of the entire journal &mdash; he is exploring a question, a question that is stated explicitly. So I ask myself, what is the question that I'm am trying to find the answer for?

I'm not sure. Currently, I feel like I am searching for myself, trying to find the *I* in me between all the thoughts, the dreams and the values that were forced onto me and that I adapted in order to fit. I sift through my mind in order to find what is truly mine and it turns out, this task is harder than I ever thought it could be...

And so, at least for now, I pose the question: *Who am I?*

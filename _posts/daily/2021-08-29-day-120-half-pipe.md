The nearest 'skatepark' near me is a halfpipe. It's a nice halfpipe, but I miss some ramps and rails and other skatepark obstacles. Unfortunately, the next skatepark is a bit further away and also always full with people. So I either have to take a 20 minute bike ride to a somewhat decent skatepark or a short walk to the halfpipes near me.

Anyway, I went to the halfpipes today with my brother and we rode around in them and practiced ramp kickturns. You get surprisingly tired even after doing a few back and forths here. 

Now I only need to learn pumping in order to stay in motion on my board in the halfpipe without pushing off the ground so often. I don't quite understand how these work, but I'm sure I'll figure it out at some point ðŸ¤”

I've been going to the nearby halfpipe the last few days and practicing riding there. Initially, I thought I would not like going there, because there is only a halfpipe and nothing else. However, I've been pleasantly suprised by how fun it can be to just roll from one side to the other and back.

I've been practicing pumping on transitions the last few days and today I finally got it down. I can build some momentum on each swing on the halfpipe and I can get pretty high up. That said, pumping is very tiring, if you do it for an extended period of time. But man, the feeling when you nearly reach the end of the halfpipe feels amazing 😁

Now that I can build some momentum, I will try to get to the top and do some basic tricks like locking in and kickturning. I'm really excited now that I've been making some visible progress 😊

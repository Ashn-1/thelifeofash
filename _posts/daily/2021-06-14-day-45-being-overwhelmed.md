Sometimes I just feel overwhelmed with my life. Nothing in particular, just all the small things at once; like small pieces of metal packed into a wrecking ball that smashes my day to bits just 'cause it feels like it. 

When I feel like this, I like to go for a walk and listen to music. It always starts with some loud as fuck metal songs that just tear through your heart, going to some quiter more heartbreaking songs and then, towards the end of my walk, the hopeful and joyous songs. Going for a walk can also be an emotional rollercoaster, you just gotta know how to do it ðŸ˜¬

Anyway, I feel like these emotional downs are just part of my life. Maybe there is a better way to handle these situations instead of going for a 2 hour walk in the middle of the night, but it works for now, so why change it, I guess... I feel like I cope with these situations better than I did a few years ago; not by a lot, but progress is progress.

Anyway, it's time to sleep, so good night ðŸ˜´

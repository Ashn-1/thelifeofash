I held the presentation of my term paper today and I'm officially done with this part of my degree! 😁

Now I need to finish a few more modules and then start working on my master thesis. It's surreal to me that after all these years I'm now getting to the last stretch of my university life. I'm kinda excited to tackle the last few months now 😎

Oh and the presentation went well 😊

Today, I had an online meditation session with my Japanese Buddhism professor from my semester abroad back in 2019. It was great seeing him again and doing some guided meditation with him, like we did back then on a weekly basis.

At the start of the meditation, he briefly talked about how meditating can help someone to be more confident in themselves. He mentioned that Buddha was once tempted by some demon, to which Buddha replied 'I know who you are, and I won't fall for it. I'm enlightened, bitch!' If he actually replied that to a demon that tried to tempt him, then I guess I'm going to become a Buddhist ðŸ˜¬

Anyway, the overall message stays the same. It is important to stay true to what you are and to tell other people off that try to tell you what they think you should be.

I went for a walk today and listened to some music. I've been really enjoying the album *Brain Invaders* by *Zebrahead* recently. Nearly every song on there is a banger, with rapping, singing, hardrock and catchy melodies and texts. I really dig their music.

Anyway, at some point I had this melody stuck in my head that I really liked, only to realize it was from one of the songs I composed some time ago. I never really recorded any songs, but I have a few 'demos' on my phone from the MIDI tracks that I composed. I really wanted to record the songs back when I made them, but somehow the whole process of recording seemed so overwhelming. So I never did.

I feel like music is one of the passions that I really want to dig into deeper, but somehow I currently don't have the motivation to do so. I feel like in a few months, when I'm done with most of my university stuff, I will have the energy to tackle this passion again. Until then, I think I'm not able to do any more than some doodling around. It's not that I currently don't have the time, but rather it feels like my mind is occupied with other things; other hobbies that I want to try out and explore further.

I'm not sure if making music will ever be an integral part of my life, but I know that music itself will always have a special place in my heart. In some weird way, music was always one of my closest friends; there for me when I had a blast and the most fun of my life and also when I was down and crying in bed. I really want to capture these moments of happiness and sadness in my own music and make them tell the story of my life. I have so many ideas of storylines I want to unravel before the ears of the listener. 

But these ideas and dreams have to wait, until I'm ready for them and I will be ready...

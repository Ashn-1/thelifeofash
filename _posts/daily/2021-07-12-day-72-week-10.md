## Recap of Week 10

- âœ… **Blog** publish next blog post
- âœ… **University** focus on finishing lectures for exam

## Focus for Week 11

- **University** start learning for the next exam
- **Blog** start writing the next blog post

I actually managed to get everything done that I wanted to focus on this week!

I finished the blog post first thing on Monday morning and then published it. The post was about my [May challenge](https://thelifeofash.com/quitting-cold-turkey/) of eating vegan. I know, that post was very late, but I managed to finish and publish it, which is all that matters ðŸ˜œ I also finished all the lectures for my exam that was last Friday. Let's say, that exam went alright. I guess there is nothing left to do other than wait and hope for the best ðŸ¥´

Next week I want to start learning for my next exam that will be in the beginning of August. I still need to watch all the lectures and exercises for this lecture... Oh well, that's gonna be a fun few weeks now ðŸ™„ I also want to start my next blog post about my yoga challenge for this month. I really want to finish this one on time and publish it on the first Sunday of August. I just want to feel what it's like, when you finish something on time. Who knows, maybe I like that feeling ðŸ¤”

> I'm huffing and puffing  
I'm running, I'm late  
I'm wheezing and panting  
I'm stopping, too late  
>
> Around I am looking  
It must have been fate  
There's someone else waiting  
It must be my date!
>
>Only now am I seeing  
Someone else beside her  
My love, oh my love  
I'll be gone, I swear...

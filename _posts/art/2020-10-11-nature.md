> Stepping out  
> Breathing in  
> Fresh air  
> In my lungs again
> 
> Walking up  
> Walking down  
> Gravel roads  
> I walk on
> 
> Cold wind blows  
> It's freezing here  
> I want to rest  
> And drink some beer
> 
> No one's judging  
> No one cares  
> If I die here  
> No one hears
> 
> Tippy toeing  
> Along the edge  
> Keep on holding  
> To the ledge
> 
> No one's asking  
> Happy, blessed?  
> Or maybe even  
> Sad and depressed?
> 
> That's nature for ya  
> Doesn't give a shit  
> She really doesn't care  
> If life gives you a hit
> 
> She'll embrace you  
> With all your sins  
> All the hatred  
> And the self-doubt within
> 
> She'll embrace you  
> With a hug  
> And she'll tell you  
> All the stories she's got
> 
> The more time I spent  
> With her in my arms  
> The more it seems  
> She's just as human as I am
> 
> My dearest friend  
> Do you see it now?  
> The reason why I  
> Go to her once in a while
> 
> One day you'll see  
> There is nothing above  
> Mother nature's embrace  
> And her undying love

I just recorded my first bass cover ever! You can find the cover on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-57o4XmpNfw).

It's kinda embarassing to say, but despite the massive popularity of this song, I never actually listened to it. Obviously I knew the beginning of the song and the chorus from memes and whatnot, but other then that I never sat down and actually listened to it. Then, a few weeks ago I started to practice bass in a more structured way using the [BassBuzz course](https://www.bassbuzz.com/). Besides learning the fundamentals for bass playing, you also learn snippets of well known bass lines. One of these was *All Star* by *Smash Mouth*.

After learning the verse in the course, I searched the whole tab online and learned the entire song. I never realized this, but this song is an absolute banger! Then, I just decided to make this my first ever bass cover.

And that's the short background story of how this bass cover came to be &mdash; enjoy! üòÅ

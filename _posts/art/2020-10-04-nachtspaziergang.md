> Sitting there in the cold dark night  
> Sipping razz and smoking outside  
> We're two, so everything's alright  
> Sincere, she looks right in my eye  
> 'Why you always stay, 'till the middle of the night?'  

<!-- more -->

> I look at her, take a sip, watch the sky  
> 'Everyone's home in their bed sleeping tight  
> Holding their loved ones in the sleep, am I right?  
> There's no one waiting in my home to reunite  
> No one's there that keeps me warm and alright'  
> 'It is late, I should go, goodbye'  
> I stand up, go my way through the night  
> 
> Music's blaring through my earphones to my brain  
> Screaming with me through the silence of my pain  
> I'm walking home, everytime, even if there were a train  
> Truth is, I don't really have a home  
> And it's driving me insane

> I'm sitting, down on the bench before  
I'm sipping, my cold-ass beer oh no  
I'm tripping, you spiked my beer, shit yo  
I'm kidding, there is my homie Moe  

<!-- more -->

> 'Sup bro, wanna hang out some more  
Sounds dope, play some tic tac toe  
Ey yo, maybe some Dobble and dope?  
Nope, I want some Dobble and rope  
> 
> You see?  
two of them free  
We gonna succeed  
Run to the tree  
> 
> Get on those things  
And do some more swings  
Get up and down  
And round and round  
> 
> I'm having fun  
It has only begun  
And when we are done  
There's gonna be none  
> 
> My stomach was full  
But it's empty now  
Drank 'til I felt dull  
Shit, anyhow  
> 
> I'm having a blast  
Right back to the cask  
Fill my glass to the brim  
Right back to the swing

> Woke up, felt shit  
> Stared at the ceiling  
> Stood up, lived life  
> I was in misery  
> Day gone, that's life  
> It's gonna be alright  
> Next day, same shit  
> Crying in my bed  
> In the middle of the fucking night  
> Yeah  
> &mdash;  
> &mdash;  
>   
> Not again, this'll end  
> This gon' be the last night  
> 1 am, winter's night  
> Going for a run now  
> Bare trees, empty streets  
> Lungs filled with cold air  
> Feeling good, I am strong  
> I can turn my life around  
> Go to bed, next day  
> I am feeling alright  
> &mdash;  
> &mdash;  
>   
> Next week, wake up  
> Stare at the ceiling  
> Life's shit, I'm down  
> It's a fucking tragedy  
> Every week, this that  
> Feels like it never ends  
> Feelin' bad, I am weak  
> Can't do this anymore  
> Take the phone, call a friend  
> Tears crashing on the floor  
> &mdash;  
> &mdash;  
>   
> Grab a pen, sit down  
> Write it all down now  
> From your head, to the paper  
> Thoughts travel down your arm  
> How you feel, what you want  
> All on a single page  
> Take a pin, to the wall  
> See it every day now  
> Fail it once, fail it twice  
> Fail a fucking thousand times  
> Cry out, get up  
> Make it better next time  
>   
> Every step, so small  
> Barely any progress made  
> Looking back, way back  
> I've come a long way  
> Fell down, got up  
> More than a thousand times  
> Feelin' shit, feelin' great  
> Yin-Yang all the way  
> Still here, still rocking  
> This game called my life  
> &mdash;  
> &mdash;  
>

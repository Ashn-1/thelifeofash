> ... Fuck    
> Off is what I should have said, drop  
> Dead what I should have felt, slit your  
> Throat you fucking piece of shit  
> Never ever did I feel like that  
> And my heart said I should forget  
> Forgive all the shit you did  
> "You love him, like your own blood"  
> Brothers what we were, fuck  
> You for taking all I had  
> Screaming all out, feeling bad  
> My fucking lungs, they collapse  
> Chest heaving, I take my last breath  
> I can't take it anymore  
> Blood is dripping on the floor  
>   
> After all the time was gone  
> Deceits and lies and victimhood  
> And all the fucking shit you talked  
> Every single time my back I turned  
> I could not take it any longer  
> I thought I would be so much stronger  
> I cut you out, my heart turned cold  
> My legs too weak to hold me up  
> My arms too weak to hold you brother  
> All because you had no lover  
> All because no one there that loved you  
> Did it ever, ever occurred to you  
> I felt the same, we talked it through  
> We were alike in all the pain  
> The hate, the sorrow, all the same  
>   
> In the end, you had it planned  
> To get the love that you deserved  
> To mend the wounds inside yourself  
> You gave it up, for one last chance  
> Your family, your friends and myself  
> And now your lost, alone, in pain  
> Your plan was shit and I am drained  
> I see your life in pieces now  
> Shattered, destroyed and you are low  
> But I, I see you and could not care  
> Enough for you, I would not even dare  
> To feel some hate towards your misery  
> I'm done with you, this ain't no victory  
> We both have lost, our pain in vain  
> Heed my last words: I hope, I never see you again.

This week I had to finish up a bunch of essays and papers for university. And when I say finish up, I of course mean start writing them. All of them. In one week. Sometimes I don't really know why past-me does this stuff to me. I just hope he at least had fun procrastinating. There was also the Chinese New Year this week and I went to Yokohama's China Town, which is the largest one in the whole of Japan.

## The Boring Stuff

I had in total five essays I had to write, three exams and a bunch of shorter texts this week. I'm not entirely sure how I made it through all of this so smoothly, but regardless I made it. As is tradition for most students, I didn't do anything before this week, so I was pretty much fucked. Well, that's not entirely true, I did finish one essay last week, but only because the deadline was on Monday. Anyway, I made it through that and on Sunday, exactly 1 hour after I finished my last essay, I went drinking with my dorm mates and doing some Karaoke afterwards. That was a great way to celebrate the end of the semester.

## Happy New Year Part II

Happy New Year to all the Chinese people!! It was Lunar New Year this Saturday, so there were a lot of festivities in the Chinese-dominant districts in Tokyo. The biggest one of those was probably in Yokohama, south of Tokyo. The biggest China Town in Japan is there, so the streets were filled with decorations and a whole lot of people were wandering around. It looked amazing with all the colors and the warm orange lights there.

There were also some Chinese style temples in the China Town district here. They looked significantly different from the standard Japanese temples. The Chinese temples here were really colorful, whereas the Japanese temples are often painted in the same red color. They were really beautiful and the lights directed at them made the colors pop out even more. Unfortunately, we arrived a little late so all the cool parades were already finished and the temples were closing. However, the festivities will go on for the whole next week, so I will go there again and actually watch the parade and the ceremonies at the temples.

Fun Fact: This year is the year of the rat, which is my Chinese zodiac. I don't really believe in that stuff, but I'm gonna make it my year anyway. Go rats!

## Last Weeks in Japan

I will have my last work day on Thursday, so afterwards I am gonna be completely free from any obligations here. Then I will have three weeks left here in Japan, where I can do whatever I want. And with whatever I of course mean nothing, because I'm kinda broke. I'm just gonna see this as a challenge for myself to make the most with the least amount of money possible.

Currently, I don't have any plans on doing any big travels in Japan anymore, instead I'm gonna explore Tokyo a little more. I feel like I didn't do much here and that there is still so much good stuff to see. Until the end of this week I am going to write together a list of things I want to do in regards of sightseeing in Japan, but also in terms of what I want to get done while I am here in terms of workload. This includes things like the Finance App I am developing and how far I want to get with my Japanese language proficiency. But more on that next week.

Also, with all the free time I have now, I can do much more fun things and have a bit more content for my future blog posts. So in the upcoming weeks now there is actually gonna be some content here, instead of me just rambling about some weird personal-philosophical question. Stay tuned!

Thank you for reading and see you next week :)

> Every path you take  
> Feels like another wasted day  
> Running 'round in circles  
> You don't seem to know your way  
> It's like getting lost in a maze  
> Crazy thoughts running amok  
> In your own head, space  
> Where you wanna go, fuck  
> All these thoughts in your head  
> Shit, there ought to be another way  
> Anyway, you barely dread dropping dead  
>   
> It feels like now I must say  
> That I'm doing fine  
> That I'm all Okay  
> That I found my way  
> Through the struggles of my life  
> Truth be told, I don't really see  
> Any future for me to be  
> A part of, drifting apart from me  
>   
> Life always hits you in the face  
> Drags your soul through the mud  
> It always feels like a race  
> Run away from yourself  
> From the future, heads up  
> Inevitably it'll catch up  
> It will fuck you up  
> Smash your head against a rock  
>   
> Then you look up,  
> See the light  
> It is shining bright  
> Right into your eyes  
> Only for you to realize  
> Its not the light of your life  
> But the end  
> Like a shining knife

> Please sit down, ring the bell  
> I've got a story to tell  
> Another round, hear me out  
> Can't wrap my head around it  
> Left my home, moved away  
> I was only fourteen  
> All my friends, back at home  
> There was no one texting  
>   
> Two years pass, get a call  
> 'I wanted to tell you something  
> Your best friend, he is dead  
> I am deeply sorry  
> Suicide, overdose  
> No one knows why he did it.'  
> I hang up, stare ahead  
> And keep on playing my game  
>   
> Look at you, disbelief  
> How can I be so heartless?  
> That's the point, I don't know  
> Maybe I am I would guess  
> Still I am, afterall  
> I am searching for it  
> What I've lost, What I miss  
> Where did they go, my feelings

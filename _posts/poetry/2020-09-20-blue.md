> Roses are red  
Violets are blue  
This poem sucks ass  
And so do you
>
> With the might of god  
And the wrath of my fist  
I'm gonna punch your gob  
Until it's blue and you get the gist
>
> Are you still sitting there silently  
Wondering 'bout what the fuck I'm saying to thee  
Did I just use 'thee' in the 21st century  
Yes Sir, I did, blueberries and trees
>
> This poem ain't 'bout berries  
And it sure ain't 'bout you  
In fact, it doesn't make any fucking sense  
But my favorite color is blue
